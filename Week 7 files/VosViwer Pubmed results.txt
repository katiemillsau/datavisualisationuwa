TI  - Optimal timing of influenza vaccine during pregnancy: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/irv.12649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women have an elevated risk of illness and hospitalisation
      from influenza. Pregnant women are recommended to be prioritised for influenza
      vaccination during any stage of pregnancy. The risk of seasonal influenza varies 
      substantially throughout the year in temperate climates; however, there is
      limited knowledge of how vaccination timing during pregnancy impacts the benefits
      received by the mother and foetus. OBJECTIVES: To compare antenatal vaccination
      timing with regard to influenza vaccine immunogenicity during pregnancy and
      transplacental transfer to their newborns. METHODS: Studies were eligible for
      inclusion if immunogenicity to influenza vaccine was evaluated in women
      stratified by trimester of pregnancy. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres,
      stratified by trimester of vaccination, had to be measured at either
      pre-vaccination and within one month post-vaccination, post-vaccination and at
      delivery in the mother, or in cord/newborn blood. Authors searched PubMed,
      Scopus, Web of Science and EMBASE databases from inception until June 2016 and
      authors of identified studies were contacted for additional data. Extracted data 
      were tabulated and summarised via random-effect meta-analyses and qualitative
      methods. RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses found
      that compared with women vaccinated in an earlier trimester, those vaccinated in 
      a later trimester had a greater fold increase in HI titres (1.33- to 1.96-fold)
      and higher HI titres in cord/newborn blood (1.21- to 1.64-fold). CONCLUSIONS:
      This review provides comparative analysis of the effect of vaccination timing on 
      maternal immunogenicity and protection of the infant that is informative and
      relevant to current vaccine scheduling for pregnant women.

TI  - Respiratory viral infection in early life and development of asthma in childhood:
      A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e15419
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000015419 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of early life wheezing that
      may contribute to the development of childhood asthma leading to increasing
      morbidity and socioeconomic burden. The aim of this review is to identify whether
      respiratory viral infections during first year of life were associated with
      development of childhood asthma. METHODS: We will search major scientific
      databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and
      ClinicalTrials.gov) using truncated and phrase-searched keywords and relevant
      subject headings. Observational studies including case-control studies, cohort
      studies, and randomized control trails published in English will be included in
      this review. Case reports, qualitative studies, and narrative overviews will be
      excluded. Exposure will be defined as laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory
      tract infection in the first year of life and outcome will be defined as
      development of asthma between ages 5 and 18 years. Effect sizes in bivariate and 
      multivariate analyses will be presented as odds or prevalence ratios. We will
      explore for heterogeneity of the standard errors across the studies, and if
      appropriate, we will perform a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to
      present a summary estimate of the odds or prevalence ratios. RESULTS: This review
      will assess whether respiratory viral infections during first year of life
      increases the risk of childhood asthma development. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic 
      review will evaluate published literature, assessing the link between early life 
      viral infection and childhood asthma. Pooled data may provide evidence that
      infantile respiratory viral infection results in higher incidence of recurrent
      wheezing and asthma, thereby stimulating further research into the
      cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines and
      nonpharmaceutical interventions such as hand-washing and respiratory hygiene
      promotion to young children. Implementing the results of such research may then
      reduce the burden of acute viral respiratory infections and subsequent recurrent 
      wheezing and asthma. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: This systematic review has
      been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018105519).

TI  - Mediterranean diet during pregnancy and childhood for asthma in children: A
      systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.
PG  - 949-961
LID - 10.1002/ppul.24338 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between high adherence to the
      Mediterranean diet in pregnancy and childhood and the risk of asthma and wheeze
      in children. METHODS: We conducted searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to 30 October 2018.
      Observational studies providing risk estimates and corresponding confidence
      intervals on the association of high adherence to the Mediterranean diet in
      pregnancy or childhood and the risk of asthma or wheeze in childhood were
      included. The methodological quality of all included studies was assessed.
      Summary odds ratios (OR) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS:
      Eighteen observational studies were included in this review. All studies were of 
      moderate to high quality. The pooled data suggested high adherence to the
      Mediterranean diet during pregnancy was associated with a reduced incidence of
      wheeze in the first 12 months (OR, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.95;
      P < 0.001), and there was an inverse association between the Mediterranean diet
      during childhood and the incidence of wheeze in the history (OR, 0.51; 95% CI,
      0.37-0.70; P = 0.001) and current wheeze (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P =
      0.013). However, there was no significant association between high adherence of
      the Mediterranean diet in pregnancy and childhood and any of the other
      meta-analysis end points including diagnosed asthma. CONCLUSION: High adherence
      to the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy and childhood may have short-term
      effects on wheeze in children in early life. However, these findings should be
      interpreted with caution owing to the heterogeneity of the studies.

TI  - Infant milk-feeding practices and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic
      dermatitis, and asthma throughout the life span: a systematic review.
PG  - 772S-799S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqy283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project, the USDA and
      Department of Health and Human Services initiated a review of evidence on diet
      and health in these populations. OBJECTIVES: The aim of these systematic reviews 
      was to examine the relation of 1) never versus ever feeding human milk, 2)
      shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding, 3) shorter versus
      longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding prior to infant formula
      introduction, 4) feeding a lower versus higher intensity of human milk to
      mixed-fed infants, and 5) feeding a higher intensity of human milk by bottle
      versus breast with food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and
      asthma. METHODS: The Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review team conducted
      systematic reviews with external experts. We searched CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase,
      and PubMed for articles published between January 1980 and March 2016,
      dual-screened the results according to predetermined criteria, extracted data
      from and assessed the risk of bias for each included study, qualitatively
      synthesized the evidence, developed conclusion statements, and graded the
      strength of the evidence. RESULTS: The systematic reviews numbered 1-5 above
      included 44, 35, 1, 0, and 0 articles, respectively. Moderate, mostly
      observational, evidence suggests that 1) never versus ever being fed human milk
      is associated with higher risk of childhood asthma, and 2) among children and
      adolescents who were fed human milk as infants, shorter versus longer durations
      of any human milk feeding are associated with higher risk of asthma. Limited
      evidence does not suggest associations between 1) never versus ever being fed
      human milk and atopic dermatitis in childhood or 2) the duration of any human
      milk feeding and allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in childhood.
      CONCLUSIONS: Moderate evidence suggests that feeding human milk for short
      durations or not at all is associated with higher childhood asthma risk. Evidence
      on food allergies, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis is limited.

TI  - Complementary feeding and food allergy, atopic dermatitis/eczema, asthma, and
      allergic rhinitis: a systematic review.
PG  - 890S-934S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqy220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutrition during infancy and toddlerhood may influence health and
      disease prevention across the life span. Complementary feeding (CF) starts when
      human milk or infant formula is complemented by other foods and beverages,
      beginning during infancy and continuing to age 24 mo. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this
      study was to describe systematic reviews conducted for the USDA and the
      Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project 
      to answer the following question: What is the relationship between the timing of 
      the introduction of complementary foods and beverages (CFBs), or types and
      amounts of CFBs consumed, and the development of food allergy, atopic
      dermatitis/eczema, asthma, and allergic rhinitis? METHODS: The literature was
      searched using 4 databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, PubMed) to identify
      articles published from January 1980 to February 2017 that met predetermined
      inclusion criteria. For each study, data were extracted and risk of bias was
      assessed. The evidence was qualitatively synthesized to develop a conclusion
      statement, and the strength of the evidence was graded. RESULTS: Thirty-one
      included articles addressed the timing of CFB introduction, and 47 articles
      addressed the types and amounts of CFBs consumed. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate evidence 
      suggests that there is no relationship between the age at which CF first begins
      and the risk of developing food allergy, atopic dermatitis/eczema, or childhood
      asthma. Limited to strong evidence, depending on the specific food, suggests that
      introducing allergenic foods in the first year of life (after 4 mo) does not
      increase the risk of food allergy and atopic dermatitis/eczema but may prevent
      peanut and egg allergy. There is not enough evidence to determine a relationship 
      between diet diversity or dietary patterns and atopic disease. Research is needed
      to address gaps and limitations in the evidence on CF and atopic disease,
      including research that uses valid and reliable diagnostic measures and accounts 
      for key confounders and potential reverse causality.

TI  - Association between ADAM33 polymorphisms and asthma risk: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.1186/s12931-019-1006-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is a common complex chronic, inflammatory polygenic disease
      with heterogeneous manifestations, affecting individuals of all age groups and
      posing an immense burden on healthcare resources. A number of studies have
      identified the association between a disintegrin and metalloprotease 33 (ADAM33) 
      polymorphisms and asthma risk, however, the results still remain inconclusive.
      The objective of the present study was to identify the effect of ADAM33 variants 
      in asthma susceptibility. METHODS: Eligible case-control studies published
      between January 2000 and June 2018 was searched and retrieved from online
      electronic databases. The odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI)
      was employed to calculate the effect. RESULTS: A total of 63 case-control studies
      were finally screened out, including 13,280 asthma patients and 13,340 controls. 
      Eleven SNPs of ADAM33 gene were identified. Our results detected a significant
      association between ADAM33 T2, Q1, F + 1 and AA genotype of T + 1 polymorphisms
      and asthma risk in total population. Subgroup analysis by ethnicities showed that
      the alleles and genotypes of T2, Q1 and F + 1 polymorphisms were associated with 
      asthma susceptibility among Asian populations, while V4 polymorphism was
      associated with asthma among Caucasian populations. Subgroup analysis by ages
      showed that T2, F + 1 and ST + 4 polymorphisms were associated with childhood
      asthma, while Q1 and V4 polymorphisms were associated with asthma risk in adults.
      Subgroup analysis by asthma severity showed that only the G allele of ADAM33 T1
      polymorphism was associated with the severity of asthma when compared with the
      controls. In addition, T2, Q1 and F + 1 polymorphisms of ADAM33 were
      significantly associated with increased the asthma risk in Chinese asthma
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results found that T2, Q1 and F + 1 polymorphisms of
      ADAM33 gene might contribute to asthma risk. Future well-designed case-control
      studies with large population and more ethnicities are still needed to estimate
      the association.

TI  - Fractional exhaled nitric oxide in preterm-born subjects: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 595-601
LID - 10.1002/ppul.24270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased lung function is common in preterm-born survivors.
      Increased fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) appears to be a reliable test
      for eosinophillic airway inflammation especially in asthma. We, systematically,
      reviewed the literature to compare FeNO levels in preterm-born children and
      adults who did or did not have chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) in
      infancy with term-born controls. METHODS: We searched eight databases up to
      February 2018. Studies comparing FeNO levels in preterm-born subjects (<37 weeks'
      gestation) in childhood and adulthood with and without (CLD) with term-born
      subjects were identified and extracted by two reviewers. Data were analysed using
      Review Manager v5.3. RESULTS: From 6042 article titles, 183 full articles were
      screened for inclusion. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen
      studies compared FeNO levels in preterm- and term-born children and adults; 11
      studies (preterm n = 640 and term n = 4005) were included in a meta-analysis. The
      mean FeNO concentration difference between the preterm-born and term-born group
      was -0.74 (95% CI -1.88 to 0.41) ppb. For the six studies reporting data on CLD
      (preterm n = 204 and term n = 211) the mean difference for FeNO levels was -2.82 
      (95% CI -5.87 to 0.22) ppb between the preterm-born CLD and term-born groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that preterm born children with and without CLD
      have similar FeNO levels to term-born children suggesting an alternative
      mechanism to eosinophilic inflammation for symptoms of wheezing and airway
      obstruction observed in preterm-born subjects.

TI  - Role of Breathing Exercises And Yoga/Pranayam In Childhood Asthma: A Systematic
      Review.
LID - 10.2174/1573396315666190121122452 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various complementary or alternative medicines (including breathing
      exercises and yoga/pranayama) have been tried as an attractive option to
      pharmacotherapy in childhood asthma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of breathing
      exercise and yoga/pranayama as add on therapy to the "pharmacologically
      recommended treatment" of childhood asthma. METHODS: We searched the published
      literature through the major databases: Medline via Ovid, PubMed, CENTRAL,
      Embase, and Google Scholar till June 2018. Randomized trials comparing breathing 
      exercises and yoga/ pranayama versus control or as part of a composite
      intervention versus control were included. The primary outcome measures were
      quality of life and change in asthma symptoms. Secondary outcomes were: decrease 
      in medication use, number of exacerbations, change in lung function and
      immunological parameters, school absenteeism, and adverse events. RESULTS: A
      total of 10 trials (466 children, 6-14 years age) were included. The severity of 
      asthma varied among the trials. The data for primary outcome measures could not
      be pooled, there were mixed results for both primary and secondary outcomes. No
      significant benefit was obtained in acute asthma, and the lung function tests
      [except PEFR % at 4-6 weeks, PEF absolute at 3 months, and FVC absolute at 3
      months] in chronic asthma. One trial compared breathing exercise versus yoga, and
      found no difference. Adverse events were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Breathing 
      exercise and yoga/ pranayama may have some additive role in the treatment of
      childhood asthma. However, at present it cannot be recommended as a standard of
      care due to insufficient data.

TI  - Validation of childhood asthma predictive tools: A systematic review.
PG  - 410-418
LID - 10.1111/cea.13336 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about the clinical usefulness of currently
      available asthma predictive tools. Validation of predictive tools in different
      populations and clinical settings is an essential requirement for the assessment 
      of their predictive performance, reproducibility and generalizability. We aimed
      to critically appraise asthma predictive tools which have been validated in
      external studies. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (1946-2017) for all
      available childhood asthma prediction models and focused on externally validated 
      predictive tools alongside the studies in which they were originally developed.
      We excluded non-English and non-original studies. PROSPERO registration number is
      CRD42016035727. RESULTS: From 946 screened papers, eight were included in the
      review. Statistical approaches for creation of prediction tools included
      chi-square tests, logistic regression models and the least absolute shrinkage and
      selection operator. Predictive models were developed and validated in general and
      high-risk populations. Only three prediction tools were externally validated: the
      Asthma Predictive Index, the PIAMA and the Leicester asthma prediction tool. A
      variety of predictors has been tested, but no studies examined the same
      combination. There was heterogeneity in definition of the primary outcome among
      development and validation studies, and no objective measurements were used for
      asthma diagnosis. The performance of tools varied at different ages of outcome
      assessment. We observed a discrepancy between the development and validation
      studies in the tools' predictive performance in terms of sensitivity and positive
      predictive values. CONCLUSIONS: Validated asthma predictive tools, reviewed in
      this paper, provided poor predictive accuracy with performance variation in
      sensitivity and positive predictive value.

AB  - Introduction: Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) has long been associated with 
      the onset of childhood asthma. The relationship between TRAP exposure and the
      development of childhood asthma phenotypes is less understood. To better
      understand this relationship, we performed a systematic review of the literature 
      studying childhood TRAP exposure and the development of childhood asthma and
      wheezing phenotypes (transient, persistent, and late-onset asthma/wheezing
      phenotypes). Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and
      Scopus databases for current literature, returning 1706 unique articles. After
      screening and selection, 7 articles were included in the final review. Due to the
      low number of articles, no meta-analysis was performed. Results: TRAP exposure
      appears to be associated with both transient and persistent asthma/wheezing
      phenotypes. However, there was little evidence to suggest a relationship between 
      TRAP exposure and late-onset asthma/wheezing. The differing results may be in
      part due to the heterogeneity in study methods and asthma/wheezing phenotype
      definitions, in addition to other factors such as genetics. Conclusion: TRAP
      exposure may be associated with transient and persistent asthma/wheezing
      phenotypes in children. The low number of studies and differing results suggest
      that further studies are warranted.

TI  - Weight Loss for Children and Adults with Obesity and Asthma. A Systematic Review 
      of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 613-625
LID - 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201810-651SR [doi]
AB  - Background: Asthma and obesity are major public health problems, affecting
      hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Obesity is associated with increased
      asthma risk and severity, and lower asthma-related quality of life. Objective: In
      this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate whether weight loss in subjects with
      obesity and asthma leads to improvement in asthma-related outcomes. Data Sources 
      and Extraction: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for all studies in English 
      published January 2000-December 2018. Studies were included if they were
      randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) for overweight/obese children or
      adults with asthma, with sufficient data to assess outcomes and study quality.
      Non-randomized and non-controlled studies were excluded, as well as those in
      subjects without overweight/obesity, or with non-asthmatic controls. Synthesis:
      We identified four RCTs involving children (total n = 246) and six involving
      adults (n = 502). All interventions were designed for weight loss and varied from
      dietary restrictions to multifactorial interventions with exercise training and
      cognitive behavioral therapy; the duration of intervention ranged from 8 weeks to
      18 months. All RCTs reported successful improvements in weight or body mass index
      (-0.14 standard deviation scores to -15.9% BMI reduction in children, 1.8%-14.5% 
      weight loss in adults). RCTs generally reported improvements in asthma-related
      quality of life and, to some degree, asthma control. RCTs involving adults also
      reported improvements in lung function (FEV1, FVC, TLC), while RCTs in children
      showed less consistent results. Conclusions: These findings suggest that weight
      loss in subjects with obesity and asthma may improve asthma outcomes. However,
      there was wide variability in populations studied, baseline and post-intervention
      assessments, follow-up length, outcome definition and reporting, and statistical 
      approaches, which hindered the ability to compare studies, perform a pooled
      analysis, or assess generalizability. Primary Source of Funding: U.S. National
      Institutes of Health (NIH).

TI  - omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy and risk of allergic outcomes or 
      sensitization in offspring: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 302-313.e2
LID - S1081-1206(18)31528-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.anai.2018.12.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases have increased worldwide in the last 2 decades,
      with children suffering the highest burden of the condition. The omega-3
      long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) possesses anti-inflammatory
      properties that could lead to a reduction in inflammatory mediators in allergies.
      OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the most recent follow-ups of
      randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was conducted to assess the effectiveness of
      omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation started during pregnancy on allergic outcomes in
      offspring. METHODS: The RCTs with a minimum of 1-month follow-up post gestation
      were eligible for inclusion. The CENTRAL, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, WHO's International
      Clinical Trials Register, E-theses, and Web of Science databases were searched.
      Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool.
      RESULTS: Ten RCTs (3,637 children), from 9 unique trials, examined the
      effectiveness of omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation started during pregnancy on the
      development of allergic outcomes in offspring. Heterogeneities were seen between 
      the trials in terms of their sample, type, and duration of intervention and
      follow-up. Pooled estimates showed a significant reduction in childhood
      "sensitization to egg" (relative risk [RR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
      0.32-0.90), and "sensitization to peanut" (RR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40-0.96). No
      statistical differences were found for other allergic outcomes (eg, eczema,
      asthma/wheeze). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that intake of omega-3 LCPUFA
      started during pregnancy can reduce the risk of sensitization to egg and peanut; 
      however, the evidence is limited because of the small number of studies that
      contributed to the meta-analyses. The current evidence on the association between
      supplementation with omega-3 LCPUFA started during pregnancy and allergic
      outcomes is weak, because of the risk of bias and heterogeneities between
      studies.

PG  - 1536097
LID - 10.1080/20018525.2018.1536097 [doi]
AB  - Background: New, complex, and expensive therapies targeting Interleukin-5 (IL-5) 
      to treat severe eosinophilic asthma are emerging. Objective: To assess efficacy, 
      adverse events, and inter-drug comparison of mepolizumab and reslizumab for
      treating severe eosinophilic asthma. Design: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis on randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials elucidating two 
      critical (exacerbation rate and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use) and six important 
      clinical outcomes on the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab and reslizumab.
      Results: Five studies (N = 2197) contributed with data for exacerbation rate,
      showing a reduction of 53% (95% CI 46; 59) in favour of anti-IL-5, corresponding 
      to -0.94 annual exacerbations (95% CI -1.08;-0.82), thus exceeding the predefined
      minimal clinical important difference (MCID) of 25% reduction of the estimated
      >/=2 annual exacerbations. Quality of evidence was considered moderate, with low 
      heterogeneity in study findings (I2 = 0%). One study (N = 135) contributed with
      data on percentage of patients experiencing >/=50% reduction inoral
      corticosteroid treatment, showing an effect of 20% (95% CI 2.3;47) in favour of
      anti-IL-5 treatment (mepolizumab), thus exceeding the predefined MCID of 10%.
      Quality of evidence was considered low. Compared to placebo, anti-IL-5 showed
      significant improvements in lung function, asthma control, and asthma-related
      quality of life, but below the MCIDs. No differences were observed for serious
      adverse events and number of patients, who dropped out. No studies evaluating
      sickleave or head-to-head comparisons were identified. By indirect comparison, we
      found no significant difference between mepolizumab and reslizumab in any ofthe
      predefined clinical outcomes. OCS treatment reduction could not be compared due
      to lack of reslizumab studies investigating this outcome. Conclusions:
      Mepolizumab and reslizumab provide significant and clinically relevant
      improvements in exacerbation rate and OCS reduction. Indirect, inter-study
      comparisons revealed no differences between the anti-IL-5 drugs in efficacy or
      safety measures.

TI  - The effects of macrolides in children with reactive airway disease: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 3825-3845
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S183527 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Childhood reactive airway diseases (RADs) are concerning problems in
      children's airways and may be preceded by bronchiolitis and may progress to
      childhood asthma. The severity of the disease is indicated by deterioration in
      pulmonary functions, increased usage of rescue medications, and recurrent
      wheezing episodes. Macrolides have both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory
      functions and have been used as adjunctive therapy in childhood RADs. Patients
      and methods: We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of macrolides in
      children with RAD. Literature searches were systematically conducted using an
      electronic database from inception to August 2018. The Cochrane review risk of
      bias assessment tool was used to assess the quality of each randomized controlled
      trial. Results: Sixteen randomized controlled trials comprising 1,415
      participants were investigated in this meta-analysis. Children treated with
      macrolide therapy showed significantly better pulmonary functions in both forced 
      expiratory volume in one second (% predicted) (difference in means=-9.77, 95%
      CI=-14.18 to -5.35, P<0.001; I (2)=0%) and forced expiratory flow 25-75 (%
      predicted) (difference in means=-14.14, 95% CI=-26.11 to -2.18, P=0.02; I
      (2)=29.56%). In addition, the short-acting beta-agonist usage days and recurrent 
      wheezing risk were significantly lowered in children with macrolide treatment
      (standardized difference in means=-0.34, 95% CI=-0.59 to -0.09, P=0.007, I
      (2)=27.05% and standardized difference in means=-0.53, 95% CI=-0.81 to -0.26,
      P<0.001, I (2)=0%, respectively). Furthermore, the growth of Moraxella
      catarrhalis from nasal swabs was less in children treated with macrolides (odds
      ratio=0.19, 95% CI=0.11-0.35, P<0.001). Children who took macrolides had a lower 
      risk of adverse events (risk ratio=0.83, 95% CI=0.70-0.98, P=0.024, I (2)=0%).
      Conclusion: This current meta-analysis suggested that adjunctive therapy with
      macrolides is safe and effective for achieving better outcomes in childhood RAD.

AB  - Children are susceptible to a variety of respiratory infections. Wheezing is a
      common sign presented by children with respiratory infections. Asthma,
      bronchiolitis, and bronchitis are common causes of childhood wheezing disease
      (CWD) and are regarded as overlapping disease spectra. Macrolides are common
      antimicrobial agents with anti-inflammatory effects. We conducted a comprehensive
      literature search and a systematic review of studies that investigated the
      influences of macrolide treatment on CWD. The primary outcomes were the impact of
      macrolides on hospitalization courses of patients with CWD. Data pertaining to
      the study population, macrolide treatment, hospital courses, and recurrences were
      analyzed. Twenty-three studies with a combined study population of 2210 patients 
      were included in the systematic review. Any kind of benefit from macrolide
      treatment was observed in approximately two-thirds of the studies (15/23). Eight 
      studies were included in the meta-analysis to investigate the influence of
      macrolides on the length of stay (LOS), duration of oxygen demand (DOD), symptoms
      and signs of respiratory distress, and re-admission rates. Although the benefits 
      of macrolide treatment were reported in several of the studies, no significant
      differences in LOS, DOD, symptoms and signs of respiratory distress, or
      re-admission rates were observed in patients undergoing macrolide treatment. In
      conclusion, any kind of benefit of macrolide treatment was observed in
      approximately two-thirds of the studies; however, no obvious benefits of
      macrolide treatment were observed in the hospitalization courses of children with
      CWD. The routine use of macrolides to improve the hospitalization course of
      children with CWD is not suggested.

TI  - Infant formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergic disease.
PG  - CD003664
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003664.pub6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infant formulas containing hydrolysed proteins have been widely
      advocated for preventing allergic disease in infants, in place of standard cow's 
      milk formula (CMF). However, it is unclear whether the clinical trial evidence
      supports this. OBJECTIVES: To compare effects on allergic disease when infants
      are fed a hydrolysed formula versus CMF or human breast milk. If hydrolysed
      formulas are effective, to determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most
      effective, including extensively or partially hydrolysed formula (EHF/PHF). To
      determine whether infants at low or high risk of allergic disease, and whether
      infants receiving early short-term (first few days after birth) or prolonged
      formula feeding benefit from hydrolysed formulas. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE 
      (1948 to 3 November 2017), and Embase (1974 to 3 November 2017). We also searched
      clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of
      retrieved articles and previous reviews for randomised controlled trials and
      quasi-randomised trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomised and
      quasi-randomised trials that compared use of a hydrolysed formula versus human
      milk or CMF. Outcomes with >/= 80% follow-up of participants from eligible trials
      were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors
      independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data from the
      included studies. Fixed-effect analyses were performed. The treatment effects
      were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence
      intervals and quality of evidence using the GRADE quality of evidence approach.
      The primary outcome was all allergic disease (including asthma, atopic
      dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and food allergy). MAIN RESULTS: A total of 16
      studies were included.Two studies assessed the effect of three to four days
      infant supplementation with an EHF while in hospital after birth versus
      pasteurised human milk feed. A single study enrolling 90 infants reported no
      difference in all allergic disease (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.38 to 5.37) or any specific
      allergic disease up to childhood including cow's milk allergy (CMA) (RR 7.11, 95%
      CI 0.35 to 143.84). A single study reported no difference in infant CMA (RR 0.87,
      95% CI 0.52 to 1.46; participants = 3559). Quality of evidence was assessed as
      very low for all outcomes.No eligible trials compared prolonged hydrolysed
      formula versus human milk feeding.Two studies assessed the effect of three to
      four days infant supplementation with an EHF versus a CMF. A single study
      enrolling 90 infants reported no difference in all allergic disease (RR 1.37, 95%
      CI 0.33 to 5.71; participants = 77) or any specific allergic disease including
      CMA up to childhood. A single study reported a reduction in infant CMA of
      borderline significance (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.00; participants = 3473).
      Quality of evidence was assessed as very low for all outcomes.Twelve studies
      assessed the effect of prolonged infant feeding with a hydrolysed formula
      compared with a CMF. The data showed no difference in all allergic disease in
      infants (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01; participants = 2852; studies = 8) 
      and children (typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; participants = 950; studies =
      2), and no difference in any specific allergic disease including infant asthma
      (typical RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.04; participants = 318; studies = 4), eczema
      (typical RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09; participants = 2896; studies = 9),
      rhinitis (typical RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.85; participants = 256; studies = 3),
      food allergy (typical RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.33; participants = 479; studies =
      2), and CMA (RR 2.31, 95% CI 0.24 to 21.97; participants = 338; studies = 1).
      Quality of evidence was assessed as very low for all outcomes. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support short-term or prolonged feeding with
      a hydrolysed formula compared with exclusive breast feeding for prevention of
      allergic disease. Very low-quality evidence indicates that short-term use of an
      EHF compared with a CMF may prevent infant CMA. Further trials are recommended
      before implementation of this practice.We found no evidence to support prolonged 
      feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF for prevention of allergic 
      disease in infants unable to be exclusively breast fed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Asthma and other wheezing disorders are common
      chronic health problems in childhood. We aim to evaluate whether the attendance
      by children under three years of age to day-care centers is a protector or risk
      factor in the development of recurrent wheezing or asthma in the following years 
      of their lives. METHODS: Systematic review of published cohort or cross-sectional
      studies, without any time limitation. We searched in PubMed, Cinhal, Cuiden and
      Scopus (EMBASE included). The quality of the studies was evaluated using the
      Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Disagreements were solved by mutual consensus. Weighted
      odds ratio (ORs) were estimated using RevMan 5.3, following random effects
      models. RESULTS: We selected 18 studies for qualitative analysis, nine cohort
      studies and nine cross-sectional studies. Day-care center attendance is
      associated with an increased risk of early recurrent wheezing (four studies;
      50,619 subjects; adjusted OR 1.87 [1.21 to 2.88]; I(2) 91%) and asthma before the
      age of six (five studies; 5412 subjects; adjusted OR 1.59 [1.26 to 2.01]; I(2)
      0%), but not later (five studies; 5538 subjects; adjusted OR 0.86 [0.55 to 1.32];
      I(2) 76%). CONCLUSIONS: Children attending day-care center during the first years
      of life have a higher risk of recurrent wheezing during the first three years and
      asthma before the age of six, but not later. This risk must be taken into account
      to inform parents in order to choose what kind of care children should have
      throughout infancy and to implement preventive measures to reduce its impact.

TI  - Effects of supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy on asthma or
      wheeze of children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2018.1529161 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy on the
      incidence of wheeze and asthma of children. METHODS: A search was conducted in
      PubMed, Embase and CENTRAL until September 2017. Randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) assessing the effects of omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy on
      wheeze/asthma of children were included. Two investigators independently searched
      articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. Outcomes 
      of relative risks were pooled. Subgroup analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Seven
      RCTs involving 2047 children were included. The pooled data revealed the
      supplementation during pregnancy reduced the incidence of wheeze/asthma (risk
      ratio (RR) 0.81; 95% CI 0.66-0.99; p .04), but the incidence of childhood asthma 
      was not significantly reduced (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.67-1.17; p .40). Subgroup
      analyses indicated that the risk of childhood wheeze/asthma was significantly
      decreased (1) in studies located in Europe (RR 0.67 95% CI 0.51- 0.88), (2) in
      children whose first-degree relatives were diagnosed with allergic disease (RR
      0.65 95% CI 0.49-0.85), (3) when a dose of omega -3 fatty acids >/=2000 mg/d was 
      applied (RR 0.61 95% CI 0.45-0.81), (4) in wheeze/asthma without sensitivity (RR 
      0.71 95% CI 0.54-0.94). CONCLUSION: The available low-quality evidence indicated 
      that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the
      incidence of wheeze/asthma of children, but incidence of asthma was not reduced
      after omega-3 fatty acids supplementation during pregnancy. More well-designed
      RCTs with large sample sizes need to be conducted to better understand the
      effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation during pregnancy with asthma
      in childhood.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The definition and diagnosis of asthma are the subject of
      controversy that is particularly intense in the case of individuals in the first 
      years of life, due to reasons such as the difficulty of performing objective
      pulmonary function tests or the high frequency with which the symptoms subside in
      the course of childhood. Since there is no consensus regarding the diagnosis of
      asthma in preschool children, a systematic review has been carried out. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: A systematic search was made of the clinical guidelines published in
      the last 10 years and containing information referred to the concept or diagnosis
      of asthma in childhood - including the first years of life (infants and preschool
      children). A series of key questions were established, and each selected guide
      was analyzed in search of answers to those questions. The review protocol was
      registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews
      (PROSPERO), with registration number CRD42017074872. RESULTS: Twenty-one clinical
      guidelines were selected: 10 general guides (children and adults), eight
      pediatric guides and three guides focusing on preschool children. The immense
      majority accepted that asthma can be diagnosed from the first years of life,
      without requiring pulmonary function tests or other complementary techniques. The
      response to treatment and the exclusion of other alternative diagnoses are key
      elements for establishing the diagnosis. Only one of the guides denied the
      possibility of diagnosing asthma in preschool children. CONCLUSIONS: There is
      generalized although not unanimous agreement that asthma can be diagnosed in
      preschool children.

TI  - Effects of caregiver-involved interventions on the quality of life of children
      and adolescents with chronic conditions and their caregivers: a systematic review
      and meta-analysis.
PG  - 13-33
LID - 10.1007/s11136-018-1976-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Childhood chronic conditions have a considerable effect on the quality
      of life (QoL) of pediatric patients and their caregivers. The purpose of this
      meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of caregiver-involved interventions on 
      the QoL of children and adolescents with chronic conditions and their caregivers.
      METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and
      Allied Health Literature, Academic Search Complete, Education Resource
      Information Center, and PsycINFO databases were searched for published randomized
      controlled trials from inception to April 2016. Two reviewers (NS and JM)
      independently screened included studies and assessed study quality. The
      meta-analyses and meta-regressions using random-effects models were performed
      with the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (version 3, Biostat, Englewood,
      NJ). RESULTS: Fifty-four studies involving 10075 pediatric patients diagnosed
      with asthma, diabetes, cancer, hypersensitivity, cerebral palsy, arthritis, or
      sickle cell diseases and 10015 caregivers were included in our analysis. The
      interventions mainly involved education about disease, skill training,
      environment change, psychological intervention, physical exercise, experience
      sharing, monitoring, or social support. The results demonstrated that
      caregiver-involved interventions significantly improved the health-related QoL
      (HRQoL) of caregivers [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.26, 95% CI
      0.14-0.38, p < 0.001], particularly those delivered through the face-to-face mode
      (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.43, p < 0.001). However, no improvements in the QoL
      (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI - 0.22 to 0.22, p = 1.00) and HRQoL (SMD = 0.06, 95% CI -
      0.02 to 0.14, p = 0.16) of children and both caregivers and children (SMD = 0.04,
      95% CI - 0.08 to 0.17, p = 0.52) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis
      provides evidence on the positive effects of caregiver-involved interventions on 
      the HRQoL of caregivers. Moreover, face-to-face mode is the delivery approach
      with a promising effect on the HRQoL of caregivers. Further research on
      conditions not found in this review is warranted.

TI  - Effect of maternal mental health improvement programs on obesity in pediatric
      populations: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 133
LID - 10.1186/s13643-018-0798-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has become a global epidemic irrespective of the
      socioeconomic status of a country or nation. Obesity increases the risk of
      various diseases in children, for example asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint
      problems, type-2 diabetes, and heart problems. The existing literature informs us
      of the many factors associated with childhood obesity. Among these factors,
      maternal mental health has been found to be a strong predictor. Maternal mental
      health programs were implemented to address the issue of childhood obesity but
      with little or no improvement. It suggests systematically reviewing the
      literature to assess the contents of these programs and carrying out
      meta-analysis for the overall effect of these interventions. METHODS: The studies
      included in this review will be experimental designs such as randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) which provide information on interventions to improve
      maternal mental health and its effects on childhood obesity. We plan to search
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, ERIC, 
      CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Scopus, and Web of Science with
      no restrictions as to language. Reference lists of the selected articles will
      also be searched for additional articles. The Cochrane EPOC Risk of Bias Tool
      will be used to assess the quality of studies. If the studies lend themselves to 
      a statistical analysis, we will also carry out a meta-analysis. DISCUSSION: This 
      review will help determine the effect of maternal health improvement programs on 
      childhood obesity. These findings, in turn, will guide the research community on 
      the development of related programs in the future. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

TI  - A Systematic Review of the Prevalence of Atopic Diseases in Children on the
      Arabian Peninsula.
PG  - 436-442
LID - 10.1159/000493267 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the available data on the prevalence of atopic diseases and 
      food allergy in children living on the Arabian Peninsula. METHODS: A PubMed
      search for relevant published articles was conducted using the following search
      terms singly or in combination: "atopy," "atopic disease," "atopic disorder,"
      "International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood," "ISAAC," "asthma,"
      "allergic rhinitis," "eczema," and "food allergy" in combination with the names
      of countries of the Arabian Peninsula (Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain,
      Qatar, Oman, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Yemen). The search captured studies
      published up to December 2017. RESULTS: A total of 8 publications reporting
      prevalence rates of any type of atopic disease in children in 7 countries of the 
      Arabian Peninsula were retrieved. The prevalence of all atopic disorders was
      comparable between countries of the Arabian Peninsula. The overall prevalence of 
      asthma ranged from 8 to 23%, while the reported prevalence of eczema ranged from 
      7.5 to 22.5%. There was great variation in the prevalence rates of
      rhinoconjunctivitis, which ranged from 6.3 to 30.5%. The prevalence of food
      allergy (8.1%) was reported for 1 country only, the United Arab Emirates.
      CONCLUSIONS: The reported overall rates of atopic disease in countries of the
      Arabian Peninsula are comparable to those reported in other industrialized
      countries. This is probably related to the good economic status in the region,
      which is reflected in the living standards and lifestyle. Further, genetic
      factors, such as factors related to gene polymorphism, and the high rate of
      consanguinity in the region may contribute to the higher prevalence of atopic
      diseases.

TI  - Antibiotics for prolonged wet cough in children.
PG  - CD004822
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004822.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common
      cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is
      protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more
      serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of
      chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes.
      Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first
      treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an
      alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to
      support this recommendation. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of antibiotics
      in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with
      bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk 
      of harm due to adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We undertook an updated search
      (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register,
      Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials
      registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest 
      searches were performed in September 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a
      control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and
      cross-over trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods as
      recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined
      criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and
      assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for
      further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat.' MAIN
      RESULTS: We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two
      were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the
      older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly
      included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration
      (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used
      amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin).We included 190 children 
      (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the
      meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment
      with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up
      (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI)
      0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number
      needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4).
      We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and
      random-effects model the I(2) statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed
      progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125
      children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI
      0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported
      adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group
      compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the
      quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except
      adverse events which we assessed as low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence
      suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic
      wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics
      have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of 
      increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a
      more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.

TI  - Probiotics supplementation in children with asthma: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 953-961
LID - 10.1111/jpc.14126 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To systematically review the effects of probiotics supplementation in
      children with asthma. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted on PubMed,
      Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge 
      Infrastructure Database, CQ VIP Database and Wanfang Data until November 2017.
      The reference lists of included studies and pertinent reviews were checked for
      supplementing our search. Randomised control trials that compared probiotics
      versus placebo were included. RESULTS: Eleven studies with a total of 910
      children met eligibility criteria. The pooled data revealed that the proportion
      of children with fewer episodes of asthma was significantly higher in the
      probiotics group than in the control group (risk ratio 1.3, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 1.06-1.59); the reduction of IL-4 (mean differences -2.34, 95% CI
      -3.38, -1.29) and the increasing of interferon-gamma (mean differences 2.5, 95%
      CI 1.23-3.76) was also significant after the treatment of probiotics.
      Nevertheless, no statistical significance was observed in childhood asthma
      control test, asthmatic symptom in the day and night, the number of symptom-free 
      days, forced expiratory volume in the first second predicted and peak expiratory 
      flow. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review does not confirm or rule out the
      beneficial effects of probiotics supplementation in children with asthma. More
      well-designed randomised control trials with larger sample sizes need to be
      conducted to evaluate the effects of probiotics in children with asthma in the
      future.

TI  - Early life vitamin D status and asthma and wheeze: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.1186/s12890-018-0679-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of asthma. 
      This study aimed to quantify the effect of early life vitamin D status on asthma 
      and wheeze later in life. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and CNKI databases,
      the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar were
      searched up to July 2017. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
      cohort studies with vitamin D level in blood (maternal or cord or infant) or
      intake (maternal intake during pregnancy or infant intake) and asthma and/or
      wheeze. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Fixed- and random-effects
      models were used to summarize the risk estimates of comparisons between highest
      vs. lowest vitamin D categories. RESULTS: Of the 1485 studies identified, three
      RCTs and 33 cohort studies were included. We did not include the RCTs (1619
      participants) in the meta-analysis as the comparators and outcome definitions
      were heterogenous. Three RCTs reported a non-statistically significant effect of 
      vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on offspring wheeze/asthma at 3 years 
      of age. Pooled estimates of cohort studies suggest no association between
      antenatal blood vitamin D levels or vitamin D intake and offspring asthma
      assessed either > 5 years or </= 5 years. The estimate for blood vitamin D
      remained unchanged when two studies assessing asthma in adulthood were excluded, 
      but a significant inverse association emerged between vitamin D intake and
      childhood asthma. We found no association between antenatal vitamin D level and
      wheeze. On the other hand, vitamin D intake during pregnancy may have a
      protective effect against wheeze. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled estimates from cohort
      studies show no association between antenatal blood vitamin D level and
      asthma/wheeze in later life. Whereas, the pooled estimates from cohort studies
      suggest that antenatal vitamin D intake may have an effect on childhood asthma > 
      5 years or childhood wheeze. The inconsistent results from studies assessing
      vitamin D either in blood or intake may be explained by previously reported
      non-linear association between blood vitamin D3 and childhood asthma. Further
      trials with enough power and longer follow-up time should be conducted to confirm
      the results.

TI  - Review on Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of Human Rhinovirus-Associated

PG  - e185-e194
LID - 10.1097/INF.0000000000001897 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The detection of human rhinoviruses (HRV) is highly prevalent in
      children with pneumonia, bronchiolitis, acute asthma and croup; however, there is
      also evidence that HRV is common in asymptomatic individuals. The majority of
      studies on the role of different HRV serotypes during acute respiratory tract
      infections episodes have limited sample size to fully characterize the
      epidemiology of HRV infection, including those from low-middle income countries, 
      where the burden of childhood respiratory disease is greatest. METHODS: We
      systematically reviewed HRV clinical and molecular epidemiology in low- and
      middle-income countries in Africa and Southeast Asia before November 2015.
      RESULTS: We identified 31 studies, which included data from 13 African and 6
      Southeast Asian countries, emphasizing the gaps in knowledge surrounding HRV
      infections. HRV was one of the most prevalent respiratory viruses detected during
      childhood respiratory disease (13%-59%); however, many studies could not
      determine the attributable role of HRV in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory
      infections due to high prevalence of detection among asymptomatic individuals
      (6%-50%). A meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the prevalence of
      HRV identification between children of different age groups; or between children 
      with severe disease compared with asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: These data 
      highlight the need for large-scale surveillance projects to determine the
      attributable etiologic role of HRV in respiratory disease.

TI  - Predictors of repeated acute hospital attendance for asthma in children: A
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1179-1192
LID - 10.1002/ppul.24068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma attacks are common and have significant physical,
      psychological, and financial consequences. Improving the assessment of a child's 
      risk of subsequent asthma attacks could support front-line clinicians' decisions 
      on augmenting chronic treatment or specialist referral. We aimed to identify
      predictors for emergency department (ED) or hospital readmission for asthma from 
      the published literature. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO,
      and CINAHL with no language, location, or time restrictions. We retrieved
      observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing factors
      (personal and family history, and biomarkers) associated with the risk of ED
      re-attendance or hospital readmission for acute childhood asthma. RESULTS: Three 
      RCTs and 33 observational studies were included, 31 from Anglophone countries and
      none from Asia or Africa. There was an unclear or high risk of bias in 14 of the 
      studies, including 2 of the RCTs. Previous history of emergency or hospital
      admissions for asthma, younger age, African-American ethnicity, and low
      socioeconomic status increased risk of subsequent ED and hospital readmissions
      for acute asthma. Female sex and concomitant allergic diseases also predicted
      hospital readmission. CONCLUSION: Despite the global importance of this issue,
      there are relatively few high quality studies or studies from outside North
      America. Factors other than symptoms are associated with the risk of emergency
      re-attendance for acute asthma among children. Further research is required to
      better quantify the risk of future attacks and to assess the role of commonly
      used biomarkers.

TI  - Effect of childhood BMI on asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of
      case-control studies.
PG  - 143
LID - 10.1186/s12887-018-1093-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is a multifactorial syndrome that threatens the health of
      children. Body mass index (BMI) might be one of the potential factors but the
      evidence is controversial. The aim of this study is to perform a comprehensive
      meta-analysis to investigate the association between asthma and BMI. METHODS:
      Electronic databases including, Web of Science, Pubmed, Scopus, Science Direct,
      ProQuest, up to April 2017, were searched by two researchers independently. The
      keywords "asthma, body mass index, obesity, overweight, childhood and
      adolescence" were used. Random and fixed effects models were applied to obtain
      the overall odds ratios (ORs) and standardized mean difference (SMD).
      Heterogeneity between the studies was examined using I(2) and Cochrane Q
      statistics. RESULTS: After reviewing 2511 articles, 16 studies were eligible for 
      meta-analysis according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. A meta-analysis from 11 
      case-control studies revealed OR of asthma and overweight as OR = 1.64; (95%
      Confidence Interval (CI): 1.13-2.38) and from 14 case-control studies, OR for
      asthma and obesity was OR = 1.92 (95% CI: 1.39-2.65), which indicated that risk
      of asthma in overweight and obese children and adolescence was significantly
      higher (1.64 and 1.92 times) than that of individuals with (p-value < 0.01 for
      underweight/normal weight in both cases). Furthermore, there was a significant
      relationship between asthma and BMI > 85 percentile according to SMD SMD = 0.21; 
      (95%CI: 0.03-0.38; p-value = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a
      significant relationship between BMI (obesity/overweight) and asthma among
      children and adolescents. It is important to study the confounding factors that
      affect the relationship between asthma and BMI in future epidemiological
      researches.

TI  - Toxocara spp. infection and risk of childhood asthma: A systematic review and

AB  - Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory disease worldwide, with a
      negative impact on quality of life and socio-economic status of patients. There
      are some evidences to suggest that Toxocara infection is a neglected risk factor 
      for childhood asthma. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to
      further understanding of this relationship. Five databases include PubMed,
      Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science (ISI), and Google scholar were searched
      (up to October 2017) to identify the relevant studies. We used random-effects
      meta-analysis model to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with the Q-test and I(2) statistic. A 
      total of 17 studies including 11 studies with case-control design (1139 patients 
      and 1023 controls) and six studies with cross-sectional design (a total of 5469
      participants, 872 asthmatics, and 4597 non-asthmatics children) met the
      eligibility criteria. An increased risk for asthma was observed in children with 
      Toxocara infection seropositivity (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.47-2.47). In sub-group
      analysis, the pooled ORs were (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.43-3.15) and (OR, 1.73; 95%
      CI, 1.23-2.44) for case-control and cross-sectional studies, respectively.
      Moreover, considering to specific IgE seropositivity, a pooled OR of 2.36 (95%
      CI, 0.93-5.98) was observed. In conclusion, this meta-analysis revealed that
      children infected with Toxocara spp. are more likely to have asthma compared to
      non-infected children. More studies (especially longitudinal studies) are needed 
      to further investigate the impact of Toxocara spp. infection on the onset or
      development of asthma.

TI  - Is childhood wheeze and asthma in Latin America associated with poor hygiene and 
      infection? A systematic review.
PG  - e000249
LID - 10.1136/bmjresp-2017-000249 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: High asthma prevalence in Latin-American cities is thought to be
      caused by poor hygiene and infections. This contradicts the widely accepted
      'hygiene hypothesis' for asthma aetiology. Methods: Systematic review of
      observational studies evaluating the association between poor hygiene exposures
      or infections and asthma/wheeze among Latin-American children aged 4-16 years.
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and CINAHL electronic databases were searched following a
      predefined strategy to 18 December 2017. We quantified outcomes measured and
      reported, assessed risk of bias and tabulated the results. Results: Forty-five
      studies included: 6 cohort, 30 cross-sectional and 9 case-control studies. 26
      cross-sectional studies were school-based surveys (14 of over 3000 children),
      whereas 5 case-control studies were hospital/health centre-based. Exposures
      measured and reported varied substantially between studies, and current wheeze
      was the most common outcome reported. Data showed selective reporting based on
      statistical significance (P value <0.05): 17/45 studies did not clearly describe 
      the number of exposures measured and 15/45 studies reported on less than 50% of
      the exposures measured. Most exposures studied did not show an association with
      wheeze or asthma, except for a generally increased risk associated with acute
      respiratory infections in early life. Contradictory associations were observed
      frequently between different studies. Conclusion: Selective reporting is common
      in observational studies exploring the association between environmental
      exposures and risk of wheeze/asthma. This, together with the use of different
      study outcomes (wheeze/asthma) associated with possibly distinct causal
      mechanisms, complicates inferences about the role of poor hygiene exposures and
      childhood infections in explaining asthma prevalence in Latin-American children.

      adult life.
PG  - 683-693
LID - 10.2147/COPD.S153555 [doi]
AB  - Background: Early life events may predispose to the development of chronic lung
      disease in adulthood. Aim: To provide an update on current knowledge of early
      nongenetic origins of COPD. Materials and methods: Systematic literature review
      was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
      and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: A total of 16 studies, comprising 69,365
      individuals, met the predefined criteria and were included in the present review.
      Studies have shown that in utero tobacco exposure, low birth weight, preterm
      birth, and respiratory diseases, primarily asthma and pneumonia, in early
      childhood are associated with lung function impairment later in childhood, and by
      that predispose to subsequent development of COPD, although the causal
      association between childhood respiratory diseases and COPD has been questioned
      in one study. Environmental tobacco exposure has also been shown to have negative
      impact on lung function in childhood possibly leading to COPD in adulthood,
      although it is at present not possible to clearly distinguish between the impact 
      of active and the environmental tobacco exposure on subsequent development of
      COPD. Conclusion: Tobacco exposure in utero and early life is a risk factor for
      subsequent development of COPD. Furthermore, low birth weight, lower respiratory 
      tract infections and asthma, including wheezy bronchitis, in childhood also seem 
      to be important determinants for later development of COPD. Early life insults
      may, therefore, be crucial to COPD development.

      adversity.
PG  - 83
LID - 10.1186/s12887-018-1037-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of and intervention in childhood adversity has
      powerful potential to improve the health and well-being of children. A systematic
      review was conducted to better understand the pediatric health outcomes
      associated with childhood adversity. METHODS: PubMed, PsycArticles, and CINAHL
      were searched for relevant articles. Longitudinal studies examining various
      adverse childhood experiences and biological health outcomes occurring prior to
      age 20 were selected. Mental and behavioral health outcomes were excluded, as
      were physical health outcomes that were a direct result of adversity (i.e.
      abusive head trauma). Data were extracted and risk of bias was assessed by 2
      independent reviewers. RESULTS: After identifying 15940 records, 35 studies were 
      included in this review. Selected studies indicated that exposure to childhood
      adversity was associated with delays in cognitive development, asthma, infection,
      somatic complaints, and sleep disruption. Studies on household dysfunction
      reported an effect on weight during early childhood, and studies on maltreatment 
      reported an effect on weight during adolescence. Maternal mental health issues
      were associated with elevated cortisol levels, and maltreatment was associated
      with blunted cortisol levels in childhood. Furthermore, exposure to childhood
      adversity was associated with alterations of immune and inflammatory response and
      stress-related accelerated telomere erosion. CONCLUSION: Childhood adversity
      affects brain development and multiple body systems, and the physiologic
      manifestations can be detectable in childhood. A history of childhood adversity
      should be considered in the differential diagnosis of developmental delay,
      asthma, recurrent infections requiring hospitalization, somatic complaints, and
      sleep disruption. The variability in children's response to adversity suggests
      complex underlying mechanisms and poses a challenge in the development of uniform
      diagnostic guidelines. More large longitudinal studies are needed to better
      understand how adversity, its timing and severity, and the presence of individual
      genetic, epigenetic, and protective factors affects children's health and
      development.

TI  - The relationship between inflammation and remodeling in childhood asthma: A
      systematic review.
PG  - 824-835
LID - 10.1002/ppul.23968 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to perform a systematic review of all studies with direct
      measurements of both airway inflammation and remodeling in the subgroup of
      children with repeated wheezing and/or persistent asthma severe enough to warrant
      bronchoscopy, to address whether airway inflammation precedes remodeling or is a 
      parallel process, and also to assess the impact of remodeling on lung function.
      METHODS: Four databases were searched up to June 2017. Two independent reviewers 
      screened the literature and extracted relevant data. RESULTS: We found 526
      references, and 39 studies (2390 children under 18 years old) were included.
      Airway inflammation (eosinophilic/neutrophilic) and remodeling were not present
      in wheezers at a mean age of 12 months, but in older pre-school children (mean
      2.5 years), remodeling (mainly increased reticular basement membrane [RBM]
      thickness and increased area of airway smooth muscle) and also airway
      eosinophilia was reported. This was worse in school-age children. RBM thickness
      was similar in atopic and non-atopic preschool wheezers. Airway remodeling was
      correlated with lung function in seven studies, with FeNO in three, and with
      HRCT-scan in one. Eosinophilic inflammation was not seen in patients without
      remodeling. There were no invasive longitudinal or intervention studies.
      CONCLUSION: The relationship between inflammation and remodeling in children
      cannot be determined. Failure to demonstrate eosinophilic inflammation in the
      absence of remodeling is contrary to the hypothesis that inflammation causes
      these changes. We need reliable, non-invasive markers of remodeling in particular
      if this is to be addressed.

TI  - Prenatal vitamin D status and respiratory and allergic outcomes in childhood: A
      meta-analysis of observational studies.
PG  - 243-253
LID - 10.1111/pai.12876 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal vitamin D status may influence offspring's respiratory and
      allergic outcomes; however, evidence is inconclusive. A systematic review and
      meta-analysis were conducted on the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      [25(OH)D] levels in maternal blood in pregnancy or cord blood at birth with the
      risk of offspring's respiratory and allergic conditions. METHODS: Two independent
      researchers conducted systematic searches for observational studies published
      until May 2017 using defined keywords on vitamin D and health outcomes, including
      respiratory tract infections (RTIs), wheeze, asthma, atopic eczema, allergic
      rhinitis, allergic sensitization, and lung function. Random-effects meta-analyses
      were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 34 from 547 retrieved articles were included.
      Increased prenatal exposure to 25(OH)D was inversely associated with risk of
      RTIs. Comparing the highest with the lowest category of 25(OH)D levels, the
      pooled odds ratio was 0.64 (95% CI 0.47, 0.87). A positive borderline association
      was found for lung function at school age (FEV1 z-score coefficient 0.07, 95% CI 
      -0.01, 0.15). No associations were found for wheeze, asthma, atopic eczema,
      allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitization. CONCLUSION: The introduction of
      public health measures to tackle vitamin D status in pregnancy may reduce the
      burden of RTIs in offspring. Current evidence does not support an impact on
      asthma and allergy.

TI  - Family and carer smoking control programmes for reducing children's exposure to
      environmental tobacco smoke.
PG  - CD001746
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD001746.pub4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children's exposure to other people's tobacco smoke (environmental
      tobacco smoke, or ETS) is associated with a range of adverse health outcomes for 
      children. Parental smoking is a common source of children's exposure to ETS.
      Older children in child care or educational settings are also at risk of exposure
      to ETS. Preventing exposure to ETS during infancy and childhood has significant
      potential to improve children's health worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
      effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce exposure of children to
      environmental tobacco smoke, or ETS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane
      Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register and conducted additional searches of
      the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, 
      Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL),
      the Education Resource Information Center (ERIC), and the Social Science Citation
      Index & Science Citation Index (Web of Knowledge). We conducted the most recent
      search in February 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included controlled trials, with 
      or without random allocation, that enrolled participants (parents and other
      family members, child care workers, and teachers) involved in the care and
      education of infants and young children (from birth to 12 years of age). All
      mechanisms for reducing children's ETS exposure were eligible, including smoking 
      prevention, cessation, and control programmes. These include health promotion,
      social-behavioural therapies, technology, education, and clinical interventions. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies
      and extracted data. Due to heterogeneity of methods and outcome measures, we did 
      not pool results but instead synthesised study findings narratively. MAIN
      RESULTS: Seventy-eight studies met the inclusion criteria, and we assessed all
      evidence to be of low or very low quality based on GRADE assessment. We judged
      nine studies to be at low risk of bias, 35 to have unclear overall risk of bias, 
      and 34 to have high risk of bias. Twenty-one interventions targeted populations
      or community settings, 27 studies were conducted in the well-child healthcare
      setting and 26 in the ill-child healthcare setting. Two further studies conducted
      in paediatric clinics did not make clear whether visits were made to well- or
      ill-children, and another included visits to both well- and ill-children.
      Forty-five studies were reported from North America, 22 from other high-income
      countries, and 11 from low- or middle-income countries. Only 26 of the 78 studies
      reported a beneficial intervention effect for reduction of child ETS exposure, 24
      of which were statistically significant. Of these 24 studies, 13 used objective
      measures of children's ETS exposure. We were unable to pinpoint what made these
      programmes effective. Studies showing a significant effect used a range of
      interventions: nine used in-person counselling or motivational interviewing;
      another study used telephone counselling, and one used a combination of in-person
      and telephone counselling; three used multi-component counselling-based
      interventions; two used multi-component education-based interventions; one used a
      school-based strategy; four used educational interventions, including one that
      used picture books; one used a smoking cessation intervention; one used a brief
      intervention; and another did not describe the intervention. Of the 52 studies
      that did not show a significant reduction in child ETS exposure, 19 used more
      intensive counselling approaches, including motivational interviewing, education,
      coaching, and smoking cessation brief advice. Other interventions consisted of
      brief advice or counselling (10 studies), feedback of a biological measure of
      children's ETS exposure (six studies), nicotine replacement therapy (two
      studies), feedback of maternal cotinine (one study), computerised risk assessment
      (one study), telephone smoking cessation support (two studies), educational home 
      visits (eight studies), group sessions (one study), educational materials (three 
      studies), and school-based policy and health promotion (one study). Some studies 
      employed more than one intervention. 35 of the 78 studies reported a reduction in
      ETS exposure for children, irrespective of assignment to intervention and
      comparison groups. One study did not aim to reduce children's tobacco smoke
      exposure but rather sought to reduce symptoms of asthma, and found a significant 
      reduction in symptoms among the group exposed to motivational interviewing. We
      found little evidence of difference in effectiveness of interventions between the
      well infant, child respiratory illness, and other child illness settings as
      contexts for parental smoking cessation interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A
      minority of interventions have been shown to reduce children's exposure to
      environmental tobacco smoke and improve children's health, but the features that 
      differentiate the effective interventions from those without clear evidence of
      effectiveness remain unclear. The evidence was judged to be of low or very low
      quality, as many of the trials are at a high risk of bias, are small and
      inadequately powered, with heterogeneous interventions and populations.

      meta-analysis.
PG  - 412-425
LID - 10.1002/ppul.23951 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the global
      prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in children and
      adolescents. METHOD: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Virtual Health
      Library-BIREME from inception to December 23, 2017. We selected observational
      studies that reported the prevalence of EIB (diagnosed by exercise challenge
      test) in children and adolescents aged 5-18 years. We conducted random-effects
      meta-analyses to estimate the pooled prevalence of EIB and 95% CI. RESULTS: We
      included 66 studies (55 696 participants, 5670 cases of EIB) in the review, of
      which 33 in general population of children and adolescents, 10 in child and
      adolescent athletes and 23 in children and adolescents with asthma. The global
      mean prevalence of EIB in the general population of children and adolescents was 
      9% (IC95%: 8-10%), with a higher rate (12%) in Asia-Pacific and America. The mean
      prevalence of EIB was 15% (95% CI: 9-21%) in child and adolescent athletes, and
      46% (95% CI: 39-53%) in children and adolescents with asthma. We estimated that, 
      globally, around 16.5 million (95% CI: 15-18 million) children and adolescents up
      to 18 years of age may have EIB. CONCLUSION: EIB in childhood should be
      considered as a global public health problem that needs more attention. The
      substantial heterogeneity between studies highlights the need for evidence-based 
      guidelines for diagnosis of EIB in this age group.

TI  - Long-term risks and benefits associated with cesarean delivery for mother, baby, 
      and subsequent pregnancies: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002494
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002494 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cesarean birth rates continue to rise worldwide with recent (2016)
      reported rates of 24.5% in Western Europe, 32% in North America, and 41% in South
      America. The objective of this systematic review is to describe the long-term
      risks and benefits of cesarean delivery for mother, baby, and subsequent
      pregnancies. The primary maternal outcome was pelvic floor dysfunction, the
      primary baby outcome was asthma, and the primary subsequent pregnancy outcome was
      perinatal death. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Cumulative 
      Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases were
      systematically searched for published studies in human subjects (last search 25
      May 2017), supplemented by manual searches. Included studies were randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) and large (more than 1,000 participants) prospective
      cohort studies with greater than or equal to one-year follow-up comparing
      outcomes of women delivering by cesarean delivery and by vaginal delivery. Two
      assessors screened 30,327 abstracts. Studies were graded for risk of bias by two 
      assessors using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) Methodology
      Checklist and the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-Randomized Studies.
      Results were pooled in fixed effects meta-analyses or in random effects models
      when significant heterogeneity was present (I2 >/= 40%). One RCT and 79 cohort
      studies (all from high income countries) were included, involving 29,928,274
      participants. Compared to vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery was associated with
      decreased risk of urinary incontinence, odds ratio (OR) 0.56 (95% CI 0.47 to
      0.66; n = 58,900; 8 studies) and pelvic organ prolapse (OR 0.29, 0.17 to 0.51; n 
      = 39,208; 2 studies). Children delivered by cesarean delivery had increased risk 
      of asthma up to the age of 12 years (OR 1.21, 1.11 to 1.32; n = 887,960; 13
      studies) and obesity up to the age of 5 years (OR 1.59, 1.33 to 1.90; n = 64,113;
      6 studies). Pregnancy after cesarean delivery was associated with increased risk 
      of miscarriage (OR 1.17, 1.03 to 1.32; n = 151,412; 4 studies) and stillbirth (OR
      1.27, 1.15 to 1.40; n = 703,562; 8 studies), but not perinatal mortality (OR
      1.11, 0.89 to 1.39; n = 91,429; 2 studies). Pregnancy following cesarean delivery
      was associated with increased risk of placenta previa (OR 1.74, 1.62 to 1.87; n =
      7,101,692; 10 studies), placenta accreta (OR 2.95, 1.32 to 6.60; n = 705,108; 3
      studies), and placental abruption (OR 1.38, 1.27 to 1.49; n = 5,667,160; 6
      studies). This is a comprehensive review adhering to a registered protocol, and
      guidelines for the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology were
      followed, but it is based on predominantly observational data, and in some
      meta-analyses, between-study heterogeneity is high; therefore, causation cannot
      be inferred and the results should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: When
      compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery is associated with a reduced
      rate of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, but this should be
      weighed against the association with increased risks for fertility, future
      pregnancy, and long-term childhood outcomes. This information could be valuable
      in counselling women on mode of delivery.

TI  - Outdoor pollen is a trigger of child and adolescent asthma emergency department
      presentations: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of increased asthma exacerbations associated with
      climatic changes such as thunderstorm asthma, interest in establishing the link
      between pollen exposure and asthma hospital admissions has intensified. Here, we 
      systematically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis of studies on pollen and
      emergency department (ED) attendance. METHODS: A search for studies with
      appropriate search strategy in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and CINAHL was
      conducted. Each study was assessed for quality and risk of bias. The available
      evidence was summarized both qualitatively and meta-analysed using random-effects
      models when moderate heterogeneity was observed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were
      included. The pollen taxa investigated differed between studies, allowing
      meta-analysis only of the effect of grass pollen. A statistically significant
      increase in the percentage change in the mean number of asthma ED presentations
      (MPC) (pooled results from 3 studies) was observed for an increase in 10 grass
      pollen grains per cubic metre of exposure 1.88% (95% CI = 0.94%, 2.82%). Time
      series studies showed positive correlations between pollen concentrations and ED 
      presentations. Age-stratified studies found strongest associations in children
      aged 5-17 years old. CONCLUSION: Exposure to ambient grass pollen is an important
      trigger for childhood asthma exacerbations requiring ED attendance. As pollen
      exposure is increasingly a problem especially in relation to thunderstorm asthma,
      studies with uniform measures of pollen and similar analytical methods are
      necessary to fully understand its impact on human health.

TI  - Acid-Suppressive Drug Use During Pregnancy and the Risk of Childhood Asthma: A
      Meta-analysis.
LID - e20170889 [pii]
LID - 10.1542/peds.2017-0889 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The association between acid-suppressive drug exposure during pregnancy 
      and childhood asthma has not been well established. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a
      systematic review and meta-analysis on this association to provide further
      justification for the current studies. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Medline,
      Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EBSCO Information Services, 
      Web of Science, and Google Scholar from inception until June 2017. STUDY
      SELECTION: Observational studies in which researchers assessed acid-suppressive
      drug use during pregnancy and the risk of childhood asthma were included. DATA
      EXTRACTION: Of 556 screened articles, 8 population-based studies were included in
      the final analyses. RESULTS: When all the studies were pooled, acid-suppressive
      drug use in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of asthma in
      childhood (relative risk [RR] = 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.56;
      I(2) = 0%; P < .00001). The overall risk of asthma in childhood increased among
      proton pump inhibitor users (RR = 1.34; 95% CI 1.18-1.52; I(2) = 46%; P < .00001)
      and histamine-2 receptor antagonist users (RR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.46-1.69; I(2) =
      0%; P < .00001). LIMITATIONS: None of the researchers in the studies in this
      meta-analysis adjusted for the full panel of known confounders in these
      associations. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that prenatal, maternal,
      acid-suppressive drug use is associated with an increased risk of childhood
      asthma. This information may help clinicians and parents to use caution when
      deciding whether to take acid-suppressing drugs during pregnancy because of the
      risk of asthma in offspring.

TI  - Applicability of evidence from previous systematic reviews on immunotherapy in
      current practice of childhood asthma treatment: a GRADE (Grading of
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) systematic review.
PG  - e016326
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016326 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because most children with asthma now use inhaled corticosteroids
      (ICS), the added benefit of immunotherapy in asthmatic children needs to be
      examined. We re-assessed the effectiveness of subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual 
      immunotherapy (SLIT) in childhood asthma treatment focusing on studies with
      patient-relevant outcome measures and children using ICS. METHODS: We used the
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
      approach to systematically search and appraise the evidence using predefined
      critical patient-relevant outcomes (asthma symptoms, asthma control and
      exacerbations). We searched to retrieve systematic reviews and randomised
      controlled trials on immunotherapy for asthma in children (1960-2017). We
      assessed the quality of the body of evidence with GRADE criteria. RESULTS: The
      quality of the evidence for SCIT was very low due to a large risk of bias and
      indirectness (dated studies in children not using ICS). No effect of SCIT was
      found for asthma symptoms; no studies reported on asthma control. For asthma
      exacerbations, studies favoured SCIT. We have little confidence in this effect
      estimate, due to the very low quality of evidence. For SLIT, quality of the
      evidence was very low due to a large risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision. 
      The outcome 'asthma symptoms' could not be calculated due to lack of
      standardisation and large clinical heterogeneity. Other predefined outcomes were 
      not reported. CONCLUSION: The beneficial effects of immunotherapy in childhood
      asthma found in earlier reviews are no longer considered applicable, because of
      indirectness (studies performed in children not being treated according to
      current asthma guidelines with ICS). There was absence of evidence to properly
      determine the effectiveness or lack thereof of immunotherapy in asthma treatment 
      in children with ICS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proper use of inhaled medication is essential for the successful
      treatment of childhood asthma; yet, improper inhaler technique among school-aged 
      children is common. There are many schoolbased asthma education programs, but the
      extent to which these programs teach inhaler technique is unknown. METHODS: We
      systematically reviewed the literature to identify schoolbased asthma
      interventions that included inhaler technique instruction. We searched several
      databases, including PubMed, for relevant articles. Studies were included if they
      were asthma interventions of any type (programs, curriculums, education)
      conducted at kindergarten through twelfth grade schools that taught inhaler
      technique and included inhaler technique as an outcome measure. Of the 285
      citations identified, the final nine studies (selected from 71 full-text
      articles) met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Findings from this systematic
      review identified a very small number of school-based interventions that
      evaluated improvements in students' inhaler technique. Two of the nine studies
      (22%) used a validated measure of inhaler technique. Inhaler technique
      instruction varied in length, from 15 min to 1 h and nurses implemented inhaler
      technique instruction in six of the nine (67%) interventions. Existing studies
      offer mixed evidence for sustained technique improvements up to a 12-month
      follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that students benefit from
      school-based inhaler technique education; however, inconsistencies in how
      technique was measured limit our ability to draw firm conclusions regarding the
      effectiveness of inhaler technique education on student outcomes. Future studies 
      are needed to identify the most appropriate and feasible inhaler technique
      education components for use in comprehensive asthma self management
      interventions.

TI  - Written action plans for children with long-term conditions: A systematic review 
      and synthesis of qualitative data.
PG  - 585-596
LID - 10.1111/hex.12643 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term conditions (LTCs) in children require a high level of
      self-management. Written action plans (WAPs) have been advocated to guide
      decision-making and support self-management but there is uncertainty about how
      WAPs "work" and what aspects are important for successful implementation.
      OBJECTIVE: To review and synthesize existing qualitative evidence about the
      design and use of WAPs across childhood LTCs. METHOD: We undertook a systematic
      search of the literature (Medline, EMBASE, CiNAHL, PsycInfo, Web of science) from
      inception to May 2015; critically appraised included studies; and synthesized the
      findings, drawing on normalisation process theory. RESULTS: 3473 titles were
      screened and 53 papers read in full. Nine studies (four key, two minor and three 
      of poor quality) contributed to our analysis, predominantly work on asthma from
      the USA and in specialist settings. WAPs may help to alleviate user worry and
      boost confidence. Confidence to act was closely linked to feelings of
      responsibility and authority. The value and use of WAPs are determined by
      multiple factors, and varies between different user groups. Logistical challenges
      include sharing a WAP between different stakeholders and keeping it up to date.
      Colour coding and pictures may enhance the appeal and usability of WAPS.
      CONCLUSION: WAPs are complex interventions but our understanding of their use and
      value in children with LTCs is limited. WAPs need to meet the needs of users who 
      have different requirements/levels of understanding and confidence according to
      their different roles. Future research into WAPs needs to be both disease and
      context-specific.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to identify risk factors of asthma
      among children < 6 years old (preschool age) for predicting asthma during the
      preschool age and early school age (</= 10 years of age). METHOD OF THE STUDY:
      MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched until June 
      30, 2017. Prospective or retrospective cohort and case-control studies were
      included. Studies had to have evaluated risk factors or a predictive model for
      developing asthma in children </= 6 years of age or persistent asthma in early
      school age. RECENT FINDINGS: A total of 17 studies were included in the analysis.
      Factors associated with developing asthma in children </= 10 years of age (both
      pre-school and early school age) included male gender (pooled OR = 1.70, P <
      0.001), atopic dermatitis (pooled OR = 2.02, P < 0.001), a family history of
      asthma (pooled OR = 2.20, P < 0.001), and serum IgE levels >/= 60 kU/l or having 
      specific IgE (pooled OR = 2.36, P < 0.001). A history of exposure to smoke or
      wheezing was also associated with persistent asthma in early school age (pooled
      OR = 1.51, P = 0.030 and pooled OR = 2.59, P < 0.001, respectively). In general, 
      asthma predictive models (e.g., API, PIAMA, PAPS) had relatively low sensitivity 
      (range, 21% to 71.4%) but high specificity (range, 69% to 98%). The study found
      that male gender, exposure to smoke, atopic dermatitis, family history of asthma,
      history of wheezing, and serum IgE level >/= 60 kU/l or having specific IgE were 
      significantly associated with developing asthma by either preschool or early
      school age. Asthma predictive models can be developed by those risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Population growth, increasing food demands, and economic efficiency
      have been major driving forces behind farming intensification over recent
      decades. However, biological emissions (bioaerosols) from intensified livestock
      farming may have the potential to impact human health. Bioaerosols from intensive
      livestock farming have been reported to cause symptoms and/or illnesses in
      occupational-settings and there is concern about the potential health effects on 
      people who live near the intensive farms. As well as adverse health effects, some
      potential beneficial effects have been attributed to farm exposures in early
      life. The aim of the study was to undertake a systematic review to evaluate
      potential for adverse health outcomes in populations living near intensive
      livestock farms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two electronic databases (PubMed and
      Scopus) and bibliographies were searched for studies reporting associations
      between health outcomes and bioaerosol emissions related to intensive farming
      published between January 1960 and April 2017, including both occupational and
      community studies. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and
      extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using a customized score. RESULTS: 38
      health studies met the inclusion criteria (21 occupational and 1 community study 
      measured bioaerosol concentrations, 16 community studies using a proxy measure
      for exposure). The majority of occupational studies found a negative impact on
      respiratory health outcomes and increases in inflammatory biomarkers among farm
      workers exposed to bioaerosols. Studies investigating the health of communities
      living near intensive farms had mixed findings. All four studies of asthma in
      children found increased reported asthma prevalence among children living or
      attending schools near an intensive farm. Papers principally investigated
      respiratory and immune system outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The review indicated a
      potential impact of intensive farming on childhood respiratory health, based on a
      small number of studies using self-reported outcomes, but supported by findings
      from occupational studies. Further research is needed to measure and monitor
      exposure in community settings and relate this to objectively measured health
      outcomes.

AB  - Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with multiple phenotypes. Epidemiologic studies
      suggest a close relationship between vitamin E and the occurrence of asthma,
      wheezing and atopic conditions during childhood. Previous results on its effects 
      have been conflicting. The aim of this meta-analysis was to critically examine
      the current evidence on the association of vitamin E with childhood asthma and
      wheezing. We searched electronic databases for observational studies in
      English-language journals published from 2000 to 2016. The initial search found
      420 titles; nineteen studies were eligible according to the abstracts and
      details, which included reporting asthma or wheeze as an outcome. None of the
      articles included in this meta-analysis reported side effects of vitamin E
      supplementation during pregnancy. This meta-analysis found that vitamin E
      supplementation during pregnancy influenced the risk of asthma. To better
      understand the effectiveness and safety of vitamin E in children with asthma,
      large-scale, well-designed and randomized controlled trials are needed.

PG  - 471-481
LID - 10.1007/s00484-017-1455-5 [doi]
AB  - The objectives of this study are to review available information on the
      association between ambient temperature and childhood asthma, and to elucidate
      the possible underlying mechanisms of this relationship. A systematic review was 
      conducted based on the papers retrieved from four databases, including PubMed,
      ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. Papers examining the association of absolute
      temperature or temperature variation with childhood asthma published from 1
      January 2000 to 31 December 2016 were included. Thirteen papers have quantified
      the effect of absolute temperature on childhood asthma, and six papers have
      examined the effect of intra- or inter-day temperature variation on childhood
      asthma. All studies were conducted in urban areas. Aeroallergen sensitizations
      were only considered in the analyses of one study. Discrepancy existed in the
      significance of the relationship between absolute temperature and childhood
      asthma, and also in the shape of this relationship (i.e. linear or non-linear)
      and whether temperature effects were lagged. Increasing evidence is suggesting
      non-linear relationship between absolute temperature and childhood asthma. Future
      research should investigate the burden of childhood asthma specifically
      attributable to extreme temperatures and temperature variation using advanced
      statistical approach, particularly in rural areas, after properly considering
      aeroallergens and air pollution. Projecting future burden of childhood asthma
      under climate change scenarios is also warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking and smoke exposure during pregnancy and childhood
      cause considerable childhood morbidity and mortality. We did a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis to investigate whether implementation of WHO's recommended
      tobacco control policies (MPOWER) was of benefit to perinatal and child health.
      METHODS: We searched 19 electronic databases, hand-searched references and
      citations, and consulted experts to identify studies assessing the association
      between implementation of MPOWER policies and child health. We did not apply any 
      language restrictions, and searched the full time period available for each
      database, up to June 22, 2017. Our primary outcomes of interest were perinatal
      mortality, preterm birth, hospital attendance for asthma exacerbations, and
      hospital attendance for respiratory tract infections. Where possible and
      appropriate, we combined data from different studies in random-effects
      meta-analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015023448.
      FINDINGS: We identified 41 eligible studies (24 from North America, 16 from
      Europe, and one from China) that assessed combinations of the following MPOWER
      policies: smoke-free legislation (n=35), tobacco taxation (n=11), and smoking
      cessation services (n=3). Risk of bias was low in 23 studies, moderate in 16, and
      high in two. Implementation of smoke-free legislation was associated with
      reductions in rates of preterm birth (-3.77% [95% CI -6.37 to -1.16]; ten
      studies, 27 530 183 individuals), rates of hospital attendance for asthma
      exacerbations (-9.83% [-16.62 to -3.04]; five studies, 684 826 events), and rates
      of hospital attendance for all respiratory tract infections (-3.45% [-4.64 to
      -2.25]; two studies, 1 681 020 events) and for lower respiratory tract infections
      (-18.48% [-32.79 to -4.17]; three studies, 887 414 events). Associations appeared
      to be stronger when comprehensive smoke-free laws were implemented than when
      partial smoke-free laws were implemented. Among two studies assessing the
      association between smoke-free legislation and perinatal mortality, one showed
      significant reductions in stillbirth and neonatal mortality but did not report
      the overall effect on perinatal mortality, while the other showed no change in
      perinatal mortality. Meta-analysis of studies on other MPOWER policies was not
      possible; all four studies on increasing tobacco taxation and one of two on
      offering disadvantaged pregnant women help to quit smoking that reported on our
      primary outcomes had positive findings. Assessment of publication bias was only
      possible for studies assessing the association between smoke-free legislation and
      preterm birth, showing some degree of bias. INTERPRETATION: Smoke-free
      legislation is associated with substantial benefits to child health. The majority
      of studies on other MPOWER policies also indicated a positive effect. These
      findings provide strong support for implementation of such policies
      comprehensively across the world. FUNDING: Chief Scientist Office Scotland, Farr

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There has been no clear consensus about whether
      prenatal exposure to air pollution contributes to the development of wheezing and
      asthma in children. We conducted a systematic review to analyze the association
      between exposure to different pollutants during pregnancy and the development of 
      childhood wheezing and asthma. METHODS: We systematically reviewed
      epidemiological studies published through June 6, 2017 available in the MEDLINE
      and Web of Science databases. We included studies that examined the association
      between prenatal exposure to any air pollutants except tobacco smoke and the
      incidence or prevalence of "wheezing" or "asthma" from birth to 14 years of age. 
      We extracted key characteristics of each included study using a template of
      predefined data items. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists
      to assess the validity of each included study. We conducted overall and subgroup 
      meta-analyses for each summary exposure-outcome association. Pooled odds ratios
      (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by using a random effects 
      model. RESULTS: Eighteen studies met our eligibility criteria. There was notable 
      variability in exposure assessment methods. The overall random effects risk
      estimates (95% CI) of different pollutants were 1.04 (0.94-1.15) aromatic
      hydrocarbons (PAH), 1.04 (1.01-1.07) NO2, 1.4 (0.97-2.03) PM2.5 for childhood
      wheeze and 1.07 (1.01-1.14) NO2, 1 (0.97-1.03) PM2.5, 1.02 (0.98-1.07) SO2, 1.08 
      (1.05-1.12) PM10 for childhood asthma. Minimal heterogeneity was seen for PAH and
      SO2, while some heterogeneity was observed for PM10, PM2.5 and NO2. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The overall and subgroup risk estimates from the meta-analyses showed
      statistically significant associations between prenatal exposures to NO2, SO2,
      and PM10 and the risk of wheezing and asthma development in childhood. There is
      insufficient evidence to show an effect of prenatal exposure to BC, CO, and O3 on
      childhood wheezing and asthma. Further studies are needed to examine the
      individual compounds' effects.

TI  - Association of breast milk fatty acids with allergic disease outcomes-A
      systematic review.
PG  - 295-312
LID - 10.1111/all.13300 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have immunoregulatory
      properties. Breast milk is rich in PUFA, and it has been hypothesized that these 
      PUFAs may be important in the aetiology of allergic diseases. Despite a growing
      body of evidence, the associations between breast milk PUFA and allergic disease 
      have not previously been systematically reviewed. METHODS: The search was
      performed in PubMed and EMBASE databases using breastfeeding, fatty acid and
      allergic disease terms. Two authors were involved in selecting papers for review 
      according to the inclusion criteria and extracting information on study
      characteristics and measures of association. Only studies that reported numeric
      associations between concentration of breast milk fatty acids and allergic
      disease outcomes were included. RESULTS: A total of 18 papers met the inclusion
      criteria, reporting results from 15 study populations. The majority were cohort
      studies (n=11), with data from only two case-control and two cross-sectional
      studies. Sample size varied between 30 and 352 participants, and follow-up time
      of the cohorts varied between 3 months and 14 years. Nine studies reported on
      eczema, seven reported on sensitization, and only five reported on asthma/wheeze.
      There was heterogeneity among studies in terms of presenting the association
      between PUFA and allergy; therefore, estimates could not be pooled. Only a few
      studies observed associations between n-3 and n-6 PUFAs and allergic disease, and
      the magnitude of this effect varied greatly. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient
      evidence to suggest that colostrum or breast milk polyunsaturated fatty acids
      influence the risk of childhood allergic diseases.

TI  - Does adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern reduce asthma symptoms in
      children? A systematic review of observational studies.
PG  - 2722-2734
LID - 10.1017/S1368980017001823 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present systematic review was to synthesize
      evidence from the literature to assess efficacy of the Mediterranean dietary
      pattern in childhood asthma. Design/Setting A systematic search of six databases,
      three clinical trial registries and hand-search of peer-reviewed articles was
      conducted up to 29 October 2016. Inclusion criteria included exposure to a
      Mediterranean dietary pattern, measurement of asthma symptoms and study
      population of children aged <18 years. Quality assessment was conducted. Due to
      significant heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not feasible. RESULTS: Of the 436
      articles identified, after removal of duplicates and based on inclusion criteria,
      fifteen observational studies conducted in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean
      countries were relevant. No randomized controlled trials were retrieved. Twelve
      studies reported an inverse association between adherence to a Mediterranean
      dietary pattern and asthma in children, two studies showed no association and one
      study showed an increase in asthma symptoms. In fourteen out of fifteen studies, 
      quality assessment checks revealed good reliability and validity among study
      methodologies. CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic review revealed a consistent
      inverse relationship (protective) between a Mediterranean dietary pattern and
      asthma in children. Future well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed 
      to provide solid evidence. Nevertheless, the existing level of evidence adds to
      the public health message relating to the beneficial effects of a
      Mediterranean-type diet in children suffering with asthma.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Exposure to phthalate esters (PAEs) has been associated with
      childhood asthma, but the congener-specific effects of PAEs on childhood asthma
      were unclear. We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze observational
      studies on the associations between specific effects of PAEs and the risk of
      childhood asthma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by
      searching three databases up to October 20, 2016. The reference lists of the
      retrieved articles were also reviewed. We included observational studies that
      reported risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations 
      between phthalate exposure and the risk of childhood asthma. Fixed-effects models
      were generally applied to calculate pooled risk estimates. When heterogeneity was
      present, random-effects models were applied. RESULTS: A total of nine studies
      featuring 43 data points were included in our final meta-analyses. Results
      indicated that the benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP) exposure had a significant
      association with the risk of childhood asthma. The Odd Ratios (ORs) were from
      1.39 to 1.41 for different combination strategies. Subgroup analyses by different
      exposure period or samples used showed that prenatal exposure to BBzP had a
      stronger association with the risk of childhood asthma (OR = 1.38, 95% CI =
      1.09-1.75), compared to those with postnatal exposure. Besides, the association
      was evident when the phthalate exposure was measured from dust samples. The OR
      for the associations between di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in dust and
      childhood asthma was 2.71 (95% CI = 1.39-5.28), and 2.08 (95% CI = 1.10-3.92) for
      BBzP. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested a positive association between DEHP and
      BBzP exposure and childhood asthma. Future studies are warranted to identify the 
      underlying mechanisms of the association.

TI  - Exposure to Perfluorinated Alkyl Substances and Health Outcomes in Children: A
      Systematic Review of the Epidemiologic Literature.
LID - E691 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14070691 [doi]
AB  - Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals used to make products stain and stick
      resistant, have been linked to health effects in adults and adverse birth
      outcomes. A growing body of literature also addresses health effects in children 
      exposed to PFAS. This review summarizes the epidemiologic evidence for
      relationships between prenatal and/or childhood exposure to PFAS and health
      outcomes in children as well as to provide a risk of bias analysis of the
      literature. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed for studies on 
      PFAS and child health outcomes. We identified 64 studies for inclusion and
      performed risk of bias analysis on those studies. We determined that risk of bias
      across studies was low to moderate. Six categories of health outcomes emerged.
      These were: immunity/infection/asthma, cardio-metabolic,
      neurodevelopmental/attention, thyroid, renal, and puberty onset. While there are 
      a limited number of studies for any one particular health outcome, there is
      evidence for positive associations between PFAS and dyslipidemia, immunity
      (including vaccine response and asthma), renal function, and age at menarche. One
      finding of note is that while PFASs are mixtures of multiple compounds few
      studies examine them as such, therefore the role of these compounds as complex
      mixtures remains largely unknown.

TI  - Prevalence of asthma among Middle Eastern children: A systematic review.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.18869/mjiri.31.9 [doi]
AB  - Background: The prevalence of asthma and allergy has increased during the last
      decades, especially in children. However, little is known about it in the Middle 
      East region. This systematic review is aimed to estimate the prevalence of asthma
      among the Middle Eastern children. Methods: Local and international scientific
      databases including SID, Iranmedex, Medline and Science Direct were
      systematically searched for relevant keywords including; asthma, prevalence,
      children, International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISACC) and
      the names of Middle Eastern countries for the period of 1996-2011. Papers in
      Persian and English which met the defined criteria were included into the study. 
      Bibliographies of the extracted articles were also searched. After extraction of 
      data, heterogeneity between studies and publication bias were measured using
      Egger's-test. Effect size was pooled by the random-effect model. Since
      significant heterogeneity was found between studies, univariate meta-regression
      analyses were done to assess the association of variables with the overall
      results. Results: Fifty studies in the Middle East examined the prevalence of
      asthma and allergy in children under the age of 18 years according to the ISAAC
      criteria and were included. A total number of 289,717 children were examined in
      the included studies and the prevalence varied from 0.7 % in Isfahan to 22.3 % in
      Bagdad. The total prevalence of diagnosed asthma was calculated 7.53 % (95% Cl:
      6.38-8.75). Prevalence of asthma in the 13-14 years age group was 7.57% (95% Cl: 
      5.78-9.29) and in 6-7 years age group was 7.43% (95% Cl: 5.75-9.10). The
      prevalence of asthma among girls, based on random effect model, was 6.30% (95%
      Cl: 4.97-7.61) and among boys, it was 8.91% (95% Cl: 6.80-11.04). Conclusion: The
      prevalence of asthma in the Middle East is lower than most developed countries.
      However, there is not enough longitudinal data to estimate the trend over time.
      In order to have more accurate estimates and to provide evidence for proper
      planning, standard epidemiologic studies should be conducted in countries of the 
      region.

TI  - Is the atopic march related to confounding by genetics and early-life
      environment? A systematic review of sibship and twin data.
PG  - 17-28
LID - 10.1111/all.13228 [doi]
AB  - A popular hypothesis known as the atopic march proposes a set of sequential
      allergy and respiratory disorders in early childhood contributes enormously to
      the burden of disease in developed countries. Although the concept of the atopic 
      march has been refined and strengthened by many cross-sectional and longitudinal 
      studies linking eczema as the initial manifestation with progression to hay fever
      and then asthma, there is yet no definitive proof that the atopic march is the
      primary causal factor in childhood allergic disease. This debate is mainly
      related to the controversy around potential confounding of these associations by 
      genetic and environmental factors. Family studies are ideally suited to
      unravelling the role of these factors. While multiple reviews have synthesized
      evidence from studies investigating this question, no review to date has explored
      specific evidence generated by twin and sibling studies to understand the
      aetiology of atopic march diseases. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review of
      twin and sibling studies that examine the allergic phenotypes that form the
      atopic march, to determine whether such analyses of data from these studies
      attempt to control for the effect confounding by shared factors, and to report
      estimates of the magnitude of associations between multiple phenotypes. Our
      review suggests that (1) genetics play a bigger role predisposing eczema to hay
      fever and eczema to asthma than environmental factors, and (2) the link between
      eczema and asthma and hay fever is independent of shared early-life environmental
      factors.

TI  - Association of Childhood Obesity and the Immune System: A Systematic Review of
      Reviews.
PG  - 332-346
LID - 10.1089/chi.2016.0176 [doi]
AB  - The growing prevalence of childhood obesity has become a serious health problem
      over the past decades. As the immune system is greatly affected by excess weight,
      in this review of reviews, we discuss the findings of review articles about the
      relationship between childhood/maternal obesity and children's immune system. We 
      searched English-language articles in PubMed, Scopus, ISI Thomson Reuters, and
      Google Scholar databases. All relevant reviews, either systematic or narrative,
      were retrieved. Then their quality was assessed by using the Assessment of
      Multiple Systematic Reviews and International Narrative Systematic Assessment
      tools, respectively. In the final step, 26 reviews were included. Our review
      suggests that childhood obesity is associated with extensive changes in the serum
      levels of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and proteins, as well as
      the number of immune cells and their behavior. Therefore, it might cause or
      exacerbate diseases such as asthma, allergy, atopic dermatitis (AD), and
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Moreover, childhood obesity may reduce the
      immune system responsiveness to vaccines and microorganisms. Furthermore, studies
      suggest that maternal obesity increases the risk of asthma in offspring. Future
      studies are needed to determine different associations of childhood obesity with 
      allergy, atophic dermatitis, and autoimmune diseases.

TI  - WITHDRAWN: Infant formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of
      allergic disease and food allergy.
PG  - CD003664
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003664.pub5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergy is common and may be associated with foods, including cow's
      milk formula (CMF). Formulas containing hydrolysed proteins have been used to
      treat infants with allergy. However, it is unclear whether hydrolysed formulas
      can be advocated for prevention of allergy in infants. OBJECTIVES: To compare
      effects on allergy and food allergy when infants are fed a hydrolysed formula
      versus CMF or human breast milk. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to
      determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective, including
      extensively or partially hydrolysed formula (EHF/PHF). To determine which infants
      at low or high risk of allergy and which infants receiving early, short-term or
      prolonged formula feeding may benefit from hydrolysed formulas. SEARCH METHODS:
      We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group
      supplemented by cross referencing of previous reviews and publications (updated
      August 2016). SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomised and quasi-randomised
      trials that compared use of a hydrolysed formula versus human milk or CMF. Trials
      with >/= 80% follow-up of participants were eligible for inclusion. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently assessed eligibility of studies for
      inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction. Primary outcomes included 
      clinical allergy, specific allergy and food allergy. We conducted meta-analysis
      using a fixed-effect (FE) model. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies assessed the effect of
      three to four days' infant supplementation with an EHF whilst in hospital after
      birth versus pasteurised human milk feed. Results showed no difference in infant 
      allergy or childhood cow's milk allergy (CMA). No eligible trials compared
      prolonged hydrolysed formula versus human milk feeding.Two studies assessed the
      effect of three to four days infant supplementation with an EHF versus a CMF. One
      large quasi-random study reported a reduction in infant CMA of borderline
      significance among low-risk infants (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.00).Prolonged infant feeding with a hydrolysed formula
      compared with a CMF was associated with a reduction in infant allergy (eight
      studies, 2852 infants; FE RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95; risk difference (RD)
      -0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to -0.01; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial
      outcome (NNTB) 25, 95% CI 12.5 to 100) and infant CMA (two studies, 405 infants; 
      FE RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.86). We had substantial methodological concerns
      regarding studies and concerns regarding publication bias, as substantial numbers
      of studies including those in high-risk infants have not comprehensively reported
      allergy outcomes (GRADE quality of evidence 'very low').Prolonged infant feeding 
      with a hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF was not associated with a
      difference in childhood allergy and led to no differences in specific allergy,
      including infant and childhood asthma, eczema and rhinitis and infant food
      allergy. Many of the analyses assessing specific allergy are underpowered.Subroup
      analyses showed that infant allergy was reduced in studies that enrolled infants 
      at high risk of allergy who used a hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF; used a
      PHF compared with a CMF; used prolonged and exclusive feeding of a hydrolysed
      formula compared with a CMF; and used a partially hydrolysed whey formula
      compared with a CMF. Studies that enrolled infants at high risk of allergy; used 
      a PHF compared with a CMF; used prolonged and exclusive feeding of a hydrolysed
      formula compared with a CMF; and used a partially hydrolysed whey formula
      compared with a CMF found a reduction in infant CMA. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We
      found no evidence to support short-term or prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed
      formula compared with exclusive breast feeding for prevention of allergy. Very
      low-quality evidence indicates that short-term use of an EHF compared with a CMF 
      may prevent infant CMA.In infants at high risk of allergy not exclusively breast 
      fed, very low-quality evidence suggests that prolonged hydrolysed formula feeding
      compared with CMF feeding reduces infant allergy and infant CMA. Studies have
      found no difference in childhood allergy and no difference in specific allergy,
      including infant and childhood asthma, eczema and rhinitis and infant food
      allergy.Very low-quality evidence shows that prolonged use of a partially
      hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF for partial or exclusive feeding was
      associated with a reduction in infant allergy incidence and CMA incidence, and
      that prolonged use of an EHF versus a PHF reduces infant food allergy.

TI  - Sex-Related Allergic Rhinitis Prevalence Switch from Childhood to Adulthood: A
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 224-235
LID - 10.1159/000464324 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sex-related switch in the prevalence of asthma from childhood (male
      predominance) to adulthood (female predominance) has been described, but for
      allergic rhinitis this remains unclear. We aimed to examine sex- and
      age-group-specific differences in allergic rhinitis prevalence by systematically 
      evaluating studies from across the globe. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE
      and Embase for population-based cross-sectional studies was performed regardless 
      of the language of publication. The search was restricted to the present
      millennium (2000 to June 2014). Study quality was defined by the sampling method,
      response rate, sample size, and data collection method. To assess sex differences
      in the prevalence of self- or parent-reported symptoms of rhinitis, calculated
      pooled estimates of the male-female ratio (MFR) were obtained using
      random-effects model meta-analyses due to heterogeneity. A meta-regression
      analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Out of 6,539 publications identified, 67
      cross-sectional population-based studies (291,726 males and 301,781 females) were
      included in our meta-analysis. In children (<11 years of age) significantly more 
      boys than girls had rhinitis symptoms (MFR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17-1.25), whereas in
      adolescents (11 to <18 years of age) males were significantly less often affected
      than females (MFR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85-0.95). No sex-specific prevalence difference 
      was observed in adults (MFR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83-1.17). These findings were
      consistent in all continents except in Asia, where the male predominance remained
      beyond childhood. CONCLUSIONS: The male predominance of rhinitis prevalence in
      childhood changed towards a female predominance in adolescence across the globe, 
      except in Asia. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these cross-sectional 
      data and examine possible determinants and underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Research Review: Childhood chronic physical illness and adult emotional health - 
      a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 753-769
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12727 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood chronic physical illness is associated with a greater
      vulnerability for emotional problems (i.e. depression and anxiety) in childhood. 
      However, little is known about life-long effects of childhood chronic physical
      illness on mental health. The present study aims to systematically review
      evidence for associations between eight chronic physical illnesses with childhood
      onset (arthritis, asthma, cancer, chronic renal failure, congenital heart
      disease, cystic fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, and epilepsy) and adult emotional
      problems. METHODS: A database search of MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and
      ScienceDirect was undertaken, and random effects meta-analyses were used to
      synthesise evidence from eligible studies. RESULTS: In total, 37 studies were
      eligible for the systematic review (n = 45,733) and of these, 34 studies were
      included in the meta-analyses (n = 45,358). There were overall associations
      between childhood chronic physical illness and adult depression (OR = 1.31; 95%
      CI [1.12, 1.54]) and anxiety (OR = 1.47; 95% CI [1.13, 1.92]). Separate
      meta-analyses for childhood asthma, type 1 diabetes and cancer were also
      conducted, with cancer being significantly associated with adult depression (OR =
      1.19; 95% CI [1.00, 1.42]). CONCLUSIONS: The effects of childhood chronic
      physical illness on the risk of emotional problems persist beyond childhood and
      adolescence. Mental health prevention and intervention strategies targeting
      children with chronic physical illnesses can have long-term benefits.

TI  - Interleukin-33 in children with asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 387-392
LID - S0301-0546(17)30016-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.aller.2016.12.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that serum interleukin 33 serving as an
      "alarmin" is increased in children with asthma. The objective of this study was
      to assess the validity of serum IL33 test for early diagnosis of childhood
      asthma. METHODS: A literature search was performed in June 2016 using PubMed,
      Embase, the Cochrane Library and other Chinese Medical Databases to identify
      studies. The search terms used were "cytokine", "interleukin-33", "asthma" and
      "children". The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software.
      Random-effects model was used to estimate the standardized mean differences
      (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of eight studies
      were included into this meta-analysis, involving 330 asthmatic children and 248
      healthy children. The meta-analysis results revealed that the serum IL33 level
      was higher in asthmatic children compared to that in healthy children (SMD=1.29, 
      95%CI=0.53-2.05, P=0.0009), with significant heterogeneity across studies
      (I(2)=94% and P<0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis showed that serum IL33
      is a helpful biomarker for early diagnosis of childhood asthma. However, owing to
      lack of enough data, the increased serum concentration of IL33 cannot be an
      indicator for the asthma severity.

TI  - Factors predicting persistence of early wheezing through childhood and
      adolescence: a systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 83-98
LID - 10.2147/JAA.S128319 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For the early identification of persistent asthma symptoms among
      young children with recurrent wheezing, it would be helpful to identify all
      available studies that have identified at least one factor for predicting the
      persistence of early wheezing. The objective of the present study was to perform 
      a systematic review of all studies that have identified factors that predict the 
      persistence of symptoms among young patients with recurring wheezing. METHODS: A 
      systematic review of relevant studies was conducted through searching in MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, CINHAL, and SCOPUS databases up to June 2016. Studies that identified
      predictors of persistence of wheezing illness among young children with recurrent
      wheezing were retrieved. Two independent reviewers screened the literature and
      extracted relevant data. RESULTS: The literature search returned 649 references, 
      619 of which were excluded due to their irrelevance. Five additional studies were
      identified from reference lists, and 35 studies were finally included in the
      review. Among all the identified predictors, the most frequently identified ones 
      were the following: family asthma or atopy; personal history of atopic diseases; 
      allergic sensitization early in life; and frequency, clinical pattern, or
      severity of wheezing/symptoms. CONCLUSION: Parental asthma (especially maternal),
      parental allergy, eczema, allergic rhinitis, persistent wheezing, wheeze without 
      colds, exercise-induced wheeze, severe wheezing episodes, allergic sensitization 
      (especially polysensitization), eosinophils (blood or eosinophil cationic protein
      in nasal sample), and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide were risk factors
      predicting persistence of early wheezing through school age. All of them are
      included in conventional algorithms, for example, Asthma Predictive Index and its
      modifications, for predicting future asthma.

TI  - Association between rhinovirus wheezing illness and the development of childhood 
      asthma: a meta-analysis.
PG  - e013034
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013034 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relation between early-life rhinovirus (RV) wheezing illness and
      later onset of wheezing/asthma remains a subject of debate. Therefore, we
      conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the association between RV wheezing
      illness in the first 3 years of life and the subsequent development of
      wheezing/asthma. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The
      PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) 
      and Wanfang databases were systematically searched for studies published between 
      1988 and February 2017, and additional studies were found by searching reference 
      lists of relevant articles. 2 reviewers independently extracted data and assessed
      the quality of each study. Results were pooled using fixed-effect models or
      random-effects models as appropriate. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 15
      original articles which met the criteria, while 10 articles reported the results 
      of 4 longitudinal cohort studies with different follow-up periods. RV wheezing
      illness in the first 3 years of life was associated with an increased risk of
      wheezing/asthma in later life (relative risk (RR)=2.00, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.49,
      p<0.001). In subgroup analysis by age at follow-up, the association still
      remained significant in <10 years (RR=2.02, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.39, p<0.001) and
      >/=10 years (RR=1.92, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.72, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The
      meta-analysis suggests an association between RV-induced wheezing in the first 3 
      years of life and the subsequent development of wheezing/asthma. Large-scale and 
      well-designed studies that adequately address concerns for potential confounding 
      factors are required to validate the risk identified in the current
      meta-analysis.

TI  - Traffic-Related Air Pollution and Childhood Asthma: Recent Advances and Remaining
      Gaps in the Exposure Assessment Methods.
LID - E312 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14030312 [doi]
AB  - Background: Current levels of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) are associated
      with the development of childhood asthma, although some inconsistencies and
      heterogeneity remain. An important part of the uncertainty in studies of
      TRAP-associated asthma originates from uncertainties in the TRAP exposure
      assessment and assignment methods. In this work, we aim to systematically review 
      the exposure assessment methods used in the epidemiology of TRAP and childhood
      asthma, highlight recent advances, remaining research gaps and make suggestions
      for further research. Methods: We systematically reviewed epidemiological studies
      published up until 8 September 2016 and available in Embase, Ovid MEDLINE (R),
      and "Transport database". We included studies which examined the association
      between children's exposure to TRAP metrics and their risk of "asthma" incidence 
      or lifetime prevalence, from birth to the age of 18 years old. Results: We found 
      42 studies which examined the associations between TRAP and subsequent childhood 
      asthma incidence or lifetime prevalence, published since 1999. Land-use
      regression modelling was the most commonly used method and nitrogen dioxide
      (NO(2)) was the most commonly used pollutant in the exposure assessments. Most
      studies estimated TRAP exposure at the residential address and only a few
      considered the participants' mobility. TRAP exposure was mostly assessed at the
      birth year and only a few studies considered different and/or multiple exposure
      time windows. We recommend that further work is needed including e.g., the use of
      new exposure metrics such as the composition of particulate matter, oxidative
      potential and ultra-fine particles, improved modelling e.g., by combining
      different exposure assessment models, including mobility of the participants, and
      systematically investigating different exposure time windows. Conclusions:
      Although our previous meta-analysis found statistically significant associations 
      for various TRAP exposures and subsequent childhood asthma, further refinement of
      the exposure assessment may improve the risk estimates, and shed light on
      critical exposure time windows, putative agents, underlying mechanisms and
      drivers of heterogeneity.

TI  - Infant formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergic disease 
      and food allergy.
PG  - CD003664
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003664.pub4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergy is common and may be associated with foods, including cow's
      milk formula (CMF). Formulas containing hydrolysed proteins have been used to
      treat infants with allergy. However, it is unclear whether hydrolysed formulas
      can be advocated for prevention of allergy in infants. OBJECTIVES: To compare
      effects on allergy and food allergy when infants are fed a hydrolysed formula
      versus CMF or human breast milk. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to
      determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective, including
      extensively or partially hydrolysed formula (EHF/PHF). To determine which infants
      at low or high risk of allergy and which infants receiving early, short-term or
      prolonged formula feeding may benefit from hydrolysed formulas. SEARCH METHODS:
      We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group
      supplemented by cross referencing of previous reviews and publications (updated
      August 2016). SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomised and quasi-randomised
      trials that compared use of a hydrolysed formula versus human milk or CMF. Trials
      with >/= 80% follow-up of participants were eligible for inclusion. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently assessed eligibility of studies for
      inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction. Primary outcomes included 
      clinical allergy, specific allergy and food allergy. We conducted meta-analysis
      using a fixed-effect (FE) model. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies assessed the effect of
      three to four days' infant supplementation with an EHF whilst in hospital after
      birth versus pasteurised human milk feed. Results showed no difference in infant 
      allergy or childhood cow's milk allergy (CMA). No eligible trials compared
      prolonged hydrolysed formula versus human milk feeding.Two studies assessed the
      effect of three to four days' infant supplementation with an EHF versus a CMF.
      One large quasi-random study reported a reduction in infant CMA of borderline
      significance among low-risk infants (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.00).Prolonged infant feeding with a hydrolysed formula
      compared with a CMF was associated with a reduction in infant allergy (eight
      studies, 2852 infants; FE RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95; risk difference (RD)
      -0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to -0.01; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial
      outcome (NNTB) 25, 95% CI 12.5 to 100) and infant CMA (two studies, 405 infants; 
      FE RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.86). We had substantial methodological concerns
      regarding studies and concerns regarding publication bias, as substantial numbers
      of studies including those in high-risk infants have not comprehensively reported
      allergy outcomes (GRADE quality of evidence 'very low').Prolonged infant feeding 
      with a hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF was not associated with a
      difference in childhood allergy and led to no differences in specific allergy,
      including infant and childhood asthma, eczema and rhinitis and infant food
      allergy. Many of the analyses assessing specific allergy are underpowered.Subroup
      analyses showed that infant allergy was reduced in studies that enrolled infants 
      at high risk of allergy who used a hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF; used a
      PHF compared with a CMF; used prolonged and exclusive feeding of a hydrolysed
      formula compared with a CMF; and used a partially hydrolysed whey formula
      compared with a CMF. Studies that enrolled infants at high risk of allergy; used 
      a PHF compared with a CMF; used prolonged and exclusive feeding of a hydrolysed
      formula compared with a CMF; and used a partially hydrolysed whey formula
      compared with a CMF found a reduction in infant CMA. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We
      found no evidence to support short-term or prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed
      formula compared with exclusive breast feeding for prevention of allergy. Very
      low-quality evidence indicates that short-term use of an EHF compared with a CMF 
      may prevent infant CMA.In infants at high risk of allergy not exclusively breast 
      fed, very low-quality evidence suggests that prolonged hydrolysed formula feeding
      compared with CMF feeding reduces infant allergy and infant CMA. Studies have
      found no difference in childhood allergy and no difference in specific allergy,
      including infant and childhood asthma, eczema and rhinitis and infant food
      allergy.Very low-quality evidence shows that prolonged use of a partially
      hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF for partial or exclusive feeding was
      associated with a reduction in infant allergy incidence and CMA incidence, and
      that prolonged use of an EHF versus a PHF reduces infant food allergy.

LID - S0301-0546(17)30005-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.aller.2016.10.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Some studies have suggested that prenatal paracetamol exposure might 
      associate with the risk of child asthma. However, other studies have not
      confirmed this result. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate
      their relationship. METHODS: Two authors searched Pubmed and Embase databases up 
      to June 2016. The strength of the association was calculated with the OR and
      respective 95% CIs. The random-effects model was chosen to calculate the pooled
      OR. RESULTS: A total of 13 articles of more than 1,043,109 individuals were
      included in the meta-analysis. A statistically significant association between
      prenatal paracetamol exposure and child asthma risk was found. The data showed
      that prenatal paracetamol exposure could increase the risk of child asthma
      (OR=1.19; 95% CI, 1.12-1.27; P<0.00001) in a random-effect model. Six studies
      reported paracetamol exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. We found
      that paracetamol exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated 
      with increased risk of child asthma (OR=1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.28; P<0.00001).
      Furthermore, we observed that paracetamol exposure during the 2-3 trimesters of
      pregnancy was also associated with child asthma risk (OR=1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.23;
      P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that prenatal paracetamol exposure
      was significantly associated with the increased risk of child asthma.

TI  - Swimming attendance during childhood and development of asthma: Meta-analysis.
PG  - 614-621
LID - 10.1111/ped.13230 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between asthma and swimming pool attendance has not
      been demonstrated and currently there are conflicting results. In order to
      clarify the association between asthma diagnosis in children and swimming pool
      attendance, and to assess the consistency of the available epidemiological
      studies, we completed a literature analysis on the relationship between the
      exposure to disinfection by-products in indoor swimming pools during childhood
      and asthma diagnosis. METHODS: Following the Meta-analysis of Observational
      Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
      reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria, a systematic review and
      meta-analysis was performed by searching MEDLINE via PubMed, TOXNET, and Scopus
      databases (from inception to 20 April 2015) using the key word "Asthma" together 
      with "swimming pool", "disinfection by-products", "indoor air pollution" and
      "children". Inclusion criteria were: English language, a complete analytic study 
      design involving a cohort of children (0-16 years), a well-defined definition of 
      exposure, and the presence of data on effect and variance. Studies on in vivo, in
      vitro or professional and accidental exposure were excluded. RESULTS: After a
      screening process, seven reports (n = 5851 subjects) were included out of a total
      of 2928 references. The reported OR of the association between swimming pool
      attendance and asthma prevalence ranged from 0.58 to 2.30. The present
      meta-analysis failed to identify a significant difference in asthma development
      between children attending swimming pools and controls (OR, 1.084; 95% CI:
      0.89-1.31). CONCLUSIONS: Swimming in childhood does not increase the likelihood
      of doctor-diagnosed asthma. Based on this meta-analysis review, the association
      of the disease with indoor pool attendance is still unclear.

TI  - Socio-economic status and quality of life in children with chronic disease: A
      systematic review.
PG  - 1062-1069
LID - 10.1111/jpc.13407 [doi]
AB  - Reduced quality of life (QoL) is a known consequence of chronic disease in
      children, and this association may be more evident in those who are
      socio-economically disadvantaged. The aims of this systematic review were to
      assess the association between socio-economic disadvantage and QoL among children
      with chronic disease, and to identify the specific socio-economic factors that
      are most influential. MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO were searched to March 2015.
      Observational studies that reported the association between at least one measure 
      of social disadvantage in caregivers and at least one QoL measure in children and
      young people (age 2-21 years) with a debilitating non-communicable childhood
      disease (asthma, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus and epilepsy)
      were eligible. A total of 30 studies involving 6957 patients were included
      (asthma (six studies, n = 576), chronic kidney disease (four studies, n = 796),
      epilepsy (14 studies, n = 2121), type 1 diabetes mellitus (six studies, n =
      3464)). A total of 22 (73%) studies reported a statistically significant
      association between at least one socio-economic determinant and QoL. Parental
      education, occupation, marital status, income and health insurance coverage were 
      associated with reduced QoL in children with chronic disease. The quality of the 
      included studies varied widely and there was a high risk of reporting bias.
      Children with chronic disease from lower socio-economic backgrounds experience
      reduced QoL compared with their wealthier counterparts. Initiatives to improve
      access to and usage of medical and psychological services by children and their
      families who are socio-economically disadvantaged may help to mitigate the
      disparities and improve outcomes in children with chronic illnesses.

TI  - Eosinophil protein X and childhood asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 114-134
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no reference guidelines for health care providers regarding
      appropriate use and interpretation of urine eosinophil protein X (u-EPX) in
      clinical practice. Currently, there are no clear-cut clinical or laboratory
      parameters to diagnose asthma in young children. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we (1)
      systematically reviewed and qualitatively appraised the epidemiological evidence 
      to determine diagnostic u-EPX cut points for pediatric asthma, and (2) performed 
      a meta-analysis to provide u-EPX estimates for diagnosing pediatric asthma.
      METHODS: Research articles in literature were identified from PubMed/Medline and 
      Web of Science databases from 1966 to August 2015. Children <18 years of age were
      included. Both serum and urine EPX were included. Twenty-seven studies met the
      inclusion criteria for the systematic review and nine studies for the
      meta-analysis. Details regarding EPX analyses, treatment efficacy, and outcomes
      were assessed. For meta-analyses, effect estimates were abstracted using
      standardized means. RESULTS: Over 70% of studies found a significant relationship
      between u-EPX and childhood asthma. There was 1.94 times higher standardized
      means of u-EPX among acute asthmatics compared to healthy controls (confidence
      interval [CI]: 1.67-2.22). Similarly, the difference in standardized means
      between asymptomatic asthmatics and healthy controls was 1.58 times higher (CI:
      1.27-1.88). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Despite differences in sample
      sizes, EPX processing and measurement, and ages of children, a consistent trend
      of higher EPX levels with childhood asthma was revealed.

TI  - Exposure to traffic-related air pollution and risk of development of childhood
      asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

LID - S0160-4120(16)30783-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.envint.2016.11.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The question of whether children's exposure to
      traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) contributes to their development of asthma
      is unresolved. We conducted a systematic review and performed meta-analyses to
      analyze the association between TRAP and asthma development in childhood. DATA
      SOURCES: We systematically reviewed epidemiological studies published until 8
      September 2016 and available in the Embase, Ovid MEDLINE (R), and Transport
      databases. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: We
      included studies that examined the association between children's exposure to
      TRAP metrics and their risk of 'asthma' incidence or lifetime prevalence, from
      birth to age 18years old. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We extracted key
      characteristics of each included study using a predefined data items template and
      these were tabulated. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists 
      to assess the validity of each included study. Where four or more independent
      risk estimates were available for a continuous pollutant exposure, we conducted
      overall and age-specific meta-analyses, and four sensitivity analyses for each
      summary meta-analytic exposure-outcome association. RESULTS: Forty-one studies
      met our eligibility criteria. There was notable variability in asthma
      definitions, TRAP exposure assessment methods and confounder adjustment. The
      overall random-effects risk estimates (95% CI) were 1.08 (1.03, 1.14) per
      0.5x10(-5)m(-1) black carbon (BC), 1.05 (1.02, 1.07) per 4mug/m(3) nitrogen
      dioxide (NO2), 1.48 (0.89, 2.45) per 30mug/m(3) nitrogen oxides (NOx), 1.03
      (1.01, 1.05) per 1mug/m(3) Particulate Matter <2.5mum in diameter (PM2.5), and
      1.05 (1.02, 1.08) per 2mug/m(3) Particulate Matter <10mum in diameter (PM10).
      Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. Across the main analysis and
      age-specific analysis, the least heterogeneity was seen for the BC estimates,
      some heterogeneity for the PM2.5 and PM10 estimates and the most heterogeneity
      for the NO2 and NOx estimates. LIMITATIONS, CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION OF KEY
      FINDINGS: The overall risk estimates from the meta-analyses showed statistically 
      significant associations for BC, NO2, PM2.5, PM10 exposures and risk of asthma
      development. Our findings support the hypothesis that childhood exposure to TRAP 
      contributes to their development of asthma. Future meta-analyses would benefit
      from greater standardization of study methods including exposure assessment
      harmonization, outcome harmonization, confounders' harmonization and the
      inclusion of all important confounders in individual studies. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

TI  - Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in infancy for the prevention of
      allergy.
PG  - CD010112
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early dietary intakes may influence the development of allergic
      disease. It is important to determine if dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFAs) given as supplements or added to infant formula prevent the development
      of allergy. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of higher PUFA intake during
      infancy to prevent allergic disease. SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search 
      strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to 14
      September 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 14 September 2015) and CINAHL (1982 to 14
      September 2015). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference
      proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised
      controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and
      quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the use of a PUFA with no PUFA
      in infants for the prevention of allergy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two
      review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and
      extracted data from the included studies. We used fixed-effect analyses. The
      treatment effects were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals
      (CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. MAIN RESULTS:
      The search found 17 studies that assessed the effect of higher versus lower
      intake of PUFAs on allergic outcomes in infants. Only nine studies enrolling 2704
      infants reported allergy outcomes that could be used in meta-analyses. Of these, 
      there were methodological concerns for eight.In infants up to two years of age,
      meta-analyses found no difference in incidence of all allergy (1 study, 323
      infants; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.26; risk difference (RD) -0.02, 95% CI -0.12
      to 0.09; heterogeneity not applicable), asthma (3 studies, 1162 infants; RR 1.04,
      95% CI 0.80 to 1.35, I(2) = 0%; RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.05, I(2) = 0%),
      dermatitis/eczema (7 studies, 1906 infants; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06, I(2) = 
      0%; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02, I(2) = 0%) or food allergy (3 studies, 915
      infants; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.19, I(2) = 63%; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to
      0.02, I(2) = 74%). There was a reduction in allergic rhinitis (2 studies, 594
      infants; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.96, I(2) = 6%; RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to
      -0.00, I(2) = 54%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome
      (NNTB) 25, 95% CI 13 to infinity).In children aged two to five years,
      meta-analysis found no difference in incidence of all allergic disease (2
      studies, 154 infants; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.02, I(2) = 43%; RD -0.16, 95% CI 
      -0.31 to -0.00, I(2) = 63%; NNTB 6, 95% CI 3 to infinity), asthma (1 study, 89
      infants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.02; RD -0.20, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.02;
      heterogeneity not applicable; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 50), dermatitis/eczema (2
      studies, 154 infants; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.24, I(2) = 0%; RD -0.09 95% CI
      -0.22 to 0.04, I(2) = 24%) or food allergy (1 study, 65 infants; RR 2.27, 95% CI 
      0.25 to 20.68; RD 0.05, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.16; heterogeneity not applicable).In
      children aged two to five years, meta-analysis found no difference in prevalence 
      of all allergic disease (2 studies, 633 infants; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19,
      I(2) = 36%; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.07, I(2) = 0%), asthma (2 studies, 635
      infants; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.53, I(2) = 0%; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.09, 
      I(2) = 0%), dermatitis/eczema (2 studies, 635 infants; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59 to
      1.09, I(2) = 0%; RD -0.04 95% CI -0.11 to 0.02, I(2) = 0%), allergic rhinitis (2 
      studies, 635 infants; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.25, I(2) = 0%; RD 0.01, 95% CI
      -0.06 to 0.08, I(2) = 0%) or food allergy (1 study, 119 infants; RR 0.27, 95% CI 
      0.06 to 1.19; RD -0.10, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.00; heterogeneity not applicable; NNTB
      10, 95% CI 5 to infinity). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that PUFA
      supplementation in infancy has an effect on infant or childhood allergy, asthma, 
      dermatitis/eczema or food allergy. However, the quality of evidence was very low.
      There was insufficient evidence to determine an effect on allergic rhinitis.

TI  - A systematic review of the association between allergic asthma and autism.
PG  - 538-550

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Autism Spectrum Disorder represents a burdensome condition in early
      childhood, with a number of risk factors proposed to explain its pathogenesis,
      most of which without a reliable scientific basis. Allergic asthma is likely to
      be one of the possible comorbilities of autism. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: In this
      paper, the relationship between autism and allergic asthma was analyzed through a
      systematic literature review, conducted according to the PRISMA Guidelines. The
      review was performed on PubMed and Science Direct database and covered the period
      January 1, 2004-July 9, 2016. The search was limited to articles published in
      peer-reviewed journals. The obtained results were sorted by relevance and the
      most significant case-control, epidemiological and nationwide-based works
      associating autism and allergic asthma in humans were selected. EVIDENCE
      SYNTHESIS: A slight correlation between these conditions has been found in more
      than a half studies selected, suggesting a possible association between the two
      diseases. Small sample sizes of some works and some methodological limitations
      rise uncertainty about this link. CONCLUSIONS: Autism Spectrum Disorder and
      asthma could be associated conditions, as evidenced by the higher prevalence of
      asthma in autistic children with respect to typically developed controls, with
      also a verisimilar biological basis. Despite that, future studies are required to
      provide more reliable data, also by employing animal models, to better clarify
      this, still unsure, relationship. Methods for study selection and inclusion
      criteria were specified in advance and documented in PROSPERO protocol
      #CRD42014012851.

TI  - Association of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to
      childhood asthma: A meta-analysis.
PG  - 423-429
LID - 10.1002/ppul.23548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As for the association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms
      with susceptibility to pediatric asthma, results of published studies yielded
      conflicts. A systematic review was conducted on the relationship between
      childhood asthma and VDR gene polymorphisms, including ApaI (rs7975232), BsmI
      (rs1544410), FokI (rs2228570), and TaqI (rs731236). METHODS: PubMed, Web of
      Science, CBM (Chinese Biomedical Database), CNKI (China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure), and Wanfang (Chinese) database were searched for relevant
      studies. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were
      calculated. RESULTS: Overall results suggested that there was a statistically
      significant association between ApaI polymorphism and childhood asthma in
      homozygote model (OR = 1.674, 95%CI = 1.269-2.208, P < 0.001) and allele model
      (OR = 1.221, 95%CI = 1.084-1.375, P = 0.001). Stratification by ethnicity
      revealed a statistical association in Asians (OR = 1.389, 95%CI = 1.178-1.638, P 
      < 0.001). There was some evidence of an association between BsmI polymorphism and
      childhood asthma in the homozygote (OR = 1.462, 95%CI = 1.016-2.105, P = 0.041)
      and allele models (OR = 1.181, 95%CI = 1.006-1.386, P = 0.042). This association 
      reached significance only in the Caucasian group (OR = 1.236, 95%CI =
      1.029-1.485, P = 0.023). For FokI, a statistical association was detected in
      dominant model (OR = 1.281, 95%CI = 1.055-1.555, P = 0.012); this association was
      significant in allele model (OR = 1.591, 95%CI = 1.052-2.405, P = 0.028) in
      Caucasian. CONCLUSION: ApaI polymorphism plays a particular role in childhood
      asthma in Asians. FokI polymorphism may be connected with pediatric asthma in
      Caucasian population. And BsmI polymorphism marginally contributes to childhood
      asthma susceptibility, while there might be no association between TaqI
      polymorphism and childhood asthma risk. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017;52:423-429. (c)

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence about the association between bisphenol
      A (BPA) exposure and childhood asthma risk. We aimed to review the
      epidemiological literature on the relationship between prenatal or postnatal
      exposure to BPA and the risk of childhood asthma/wheeze. METHODS: The PubMed
      database was systematically searched, and additional studies were found by
      searching reference lists of relevant articles. RESULTS: Six studies fulfilled
      the eligibility criteria. Three studies found that prenatal BPA exposure is
      associated with an increased risk of childhood wheeze, while another study
      reported a reduced risk of wheeze. Regarding the postnatal BPA exposure, three
      studies demonstrated an increased risk of childhood asthma/wheeze. CONCLUSIONS:
      The mean prenatal BPA was associated with the risk of childhood wheeze/asthma.
      Besides, the influence of BPA exposure during the second trimester of pregnancy
      on the prevalence of childhood wheeze was marked. Further studies are urgently
      needed to explore the underlying mechanism about adverse effect of BPA exposure
      on childhood wheeze/asthma.

LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.55.5546 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine
      auxiliary therapy (CHMAT) in treating childhood cough variant asthma (CVA). A
      systematic literature review was conducted on RCTs that compared CHMAT, i.e.,
      Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) plus pharmacotherapy (PT), versus the same PT alone
      in the treatment of CVA. All included trials were assessed for quality and risk
      bias and analyzed according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook based on the
      Review Manager 5.3 software program. Twenty studies were identified and the CHMAT
      group had a positive effect on the total effective rate and a lower recurrence
      rate compared with the control group. CHMAT may have positive effects on CVA,
      leading to better improvement in disorders of cough and asthma and less adverse
      effects. However, the methodology and reporting quality of current studies are
      generally low. Further studies should include larger sample sizes with a strict
      design to confirm these findings.

TI  - Aminophylline Dosage In Asthma Exacerbations in Children: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e0159965
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0159965 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate asthma treatment of childhood exacerbations with IV
      aminophylline depends on appropriate dosage. Recommendations to aim for a target 
      therapeutic range may be inappropriate as serum concentrations correlate poorly
      with clinical improvement. This review aims to evaluate the evidence for the
      optimum dosage strategy of intravenous aminophylline in children suffering an
      exacerbation of asthma. METHODS: A systematic review comparing dosage regimens of
      intravenous aminophylline in children suffering an exacerbation of asthma.
      Primary outcomes were time until resolution of symptoms, mortality and need for
      mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were date until discharge criteria are
      met, actual discharge and adverse effects. DATA SOURCES: CENTRAL, CINAHL, MEDLINE
      and Web of Science. Search performed in March 2016. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies
      using intravenous aminophylline in children with an acute exacerbation of asthma 
      which reported the dosage and clinical outcomes. FINDINGS: 14 RCTs were included.
      There is a poor relationship between the dosage administered to children and
      symptom resolution, length of stay or need for mechanical ventilation. This study
      is limited due to its use of indirect evidence. CONCLUSION: The currently
      recommended dosage regimens may not represent the optimum safety and efficacy of 
      intravenous aminophylline. There is a need to develop the evidence base
      correlating dosage with patient centered clinical outcomes, to improve
      prescribing practices.

TI  - Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide for the Diagnosis of Childhood Asthma: a
      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 129-138

AB  - The gold standard for diagnosing asthma in children is based on clinical history 
      of respiratory symptoms, physical examination, and respiratory function testing. 
      Recent advances indicate that a non-invasive measure of airway inflammation,
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), provides objective data for use in asthma
      diagnosis. However, the diagnostic performance of FeNO in children with asthma
      has not been clearly defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to
      evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FeNO in the clinical determination of asthma 
      in children. Databases of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDION, and Web
      of Science were searched for relevant articles through March 31, 2016. A
      bivariate model was used for pooling estimates of sensitivity, specificity,
      diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the summary receiver operating curves
      (SROC) as the main diagnostic measures. In total, eight studies met the inclusion
      criteria, which included 2933 subjects. The pooled estimates of sensitivity,
      specificity, and DOR for the detection of asthma in children were 0.79 [95 %
      confidence interval (CI), 0.64-0.89], 0.81 (95 % CI, 0.66-0.90), and 16.52 (95 % 
      CI, 7.64-35.71). The SROC was 0.87 (95 % CI, 0.84-0.90). In brief, FeNO achieves 
      a moderate diagnostic performance in the detection of asthma in children.

TI  - A Systematic Review of the Interplay Between Social Determinants and
      Environmental Exposures for Early-Life Outcomes.
PG  - 287-301
LID - 10.1007/s40572-016-0099-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Early-life social and environmental exposures have independent
      effects on many child health outcomes. Increasingly, investigators have suggested
      that these exposures, which commonly co-occur, may have synergistic effects and
      have thus begun to evaluate if environmental and social factors jointly
      contribute to child health. This systematic review summarizes findings and
      methodological approaches across studies examining the interplay between
      environmental and social exposures in relation to commonly assessed childhood
      health outcomes: asthma, cognition and behavior, perinatal outcomes, and obesity.
      RECENT FINDINGS: Forty-one studies met the search criteria and were reviewed. Of 
      these, 37, 34, and 29 % of studies focused on asthma, cognition/behavior, and
      perinatal outcomes, respectively. No study focused on obesity. Across all studies
      reviewed, 72 % observed significant synergistic associations between social and
      environmental exposures. Air pollution was the most frequently studied
      environmental exposure, and socioeconomic status was the most commonly studied
      social factor. The emerging evidence suggests that social and environmental risks
      may jointly affect child health. Recommendations for future research are
      discussed, including enhancing characterization of the social environment and
      broadening the types of environmental risks assessed.

PG  - 75
LID - 10.7748/ncyp.28.4.75.s60 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Theme: Parenting/parenthood. INTRODUCTION: As delivering care is an
      inherent part of becoming parents, providing high-level care to the child with
      health problems might be a burden for the caregiver. AIM: This systematic review 
      investigated the effects of caregiver burden of parents who are primarily
      responsible for the caring of children with asthma. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, Web 
      of Science and Scopus databases were searched for the studies published between
      2000-2015. Key search terms used were 'caregiver', 'burden, 'childhood asthma'
      and 'parent'. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies were examined for this review.
      DISCUSSION: Providing care to the child with asthma affects parents as caregivers
      negatively. Caregivers of the children with asthma often experience anxiety,
      fear, disappointment, grief, physical distress and low quality of life as the
      outcomes of caregiving burden. CONCLUSIONS: It is absolutely crucial to determine
      caregiver burden risks and protective factors since wellness level of caregivers 
      affect the asthma management practices and decisions.

AB  - It has been known for many years that multiple early life factors can adversely
      affect lung function and future respiratory health. This is the first systematic 
      review to attempt to analyse all these factors simultaneously. We adhered to
      strict a priori criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies. The initial
      search yielded 29,351 citations of which 208 articles were reviewed in full and
      25 were included in the review. This included 6 birth cohorts and 19 longitudinal
      population studies. The 25 studies reported the effect of 74 childhood factors
      (on their own or in combinations with other factors) on subsequent lung function 
      reported as percent predicted forced expiration in one second (FEV1). The
      childhood factors that were associated with a significant reduction in future
      FEV1 could be grouped as: early infection, bronchial hyper-reactivity (BHR) /
      airway lability, a diagnosis of asthma, wheeze, family history of atopy or
      asthma, respiratory symptoms and prematurity / low birth weight. A complete
      mathematical model will only be possible if the raw data from all previous
      studies is made available. This highlights the need for increased cooperation
      between researchers and the need for international consensus about the outcome
      measures for future longitudinal studies.

TI  - Maternal vitamin D status and childhood asthma, wheeze, and eczema: A systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 612-9
LID - 10.1111/pai.12593 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal vitamin D status has been reported to be associated with
      childhood allergic diseases. However, this association remains to be fully
      elucidated. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using
      prospective cohort studies that examined the association between maternal vitamin
      D status and childhood allergic diseases including wheeze, eczema and asthma. We 
      searched electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, the
      Wanfang (Chinese) database, the VIP (Chinese) database, and Chinese National
      Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) up to August 2014. Odds ratios and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) from individual studies were synthesized using a fixed effects
      model. RESULTS: Four studies on the association between maternal vitamin D status
      and childhood asthma (3666 mother-child pairs), four studies on the association
      between maternal vitamin D status and childhood wheeze (2225 mother-child pairs) 
      and three papers on the association between maternal vitamin D status and
      childhood eczema (2172 mother-child pairs) met our inclusion criteria. Maternal
      vitamin D status during pregnancy was associated with childhood eczema (pooled
      OR=0.904, 95% CI=0.831-0.983). However, the meta-analysis showed no statistical
      association between maternal vitamin D status and childhood asthma (pooled
      OR=0.981, 95% CI=0.944-1.019) or childhood wheeze (pooled OR=0.995, 95%
      CI=0.982-1.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis found that lower maternal vitamin
      D during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of childhood eczema but 
      was not associated with childhood asthma or wheeze. The role of maternal vitamin 
      D as an important protective factor for the development of childhood eczema
      remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Etiology of molar incisor hypomineralization - A systematic review.
PG  - 342-53
LID - 10.1111/cdoe.12229 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) is a common developmental
      dental defect of permanent teeth, which can increase the risk of dental caries,
      infection and hospitalization. The etiology is currently unclear although
      prenatal or early childhood health factors are suspected. The aim of this
      systematic review was to assess the strength of evidence linking etiological
      factors with MIH. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using the Medline
      and Embase electronic databases for studies investigating environmental
      etiological factors of MIH. Two reviewers assessed the eligibility of studies.
      The level of evidence and bias was determined for all eligible studies according 
      to Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for
      systematic reviews of etiology and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: From a
      total of 2254 studies identified through electronic and hand searching, 28 were
      eligible for inclusion. Twenty-five of these investigated MIH and three
      investigated a related condition in primary teeth, hypomineralized second primary
      molars (HSPM), and these were analysed separately. A limited number of studies
      reported significant associations between MIH and pre- and perinatal factors such
      as maternal illness and medication use in pregnancy, prematurity and birth
      complications. Early childhood illness was implicated as an etiological factor in
      MIH in several studies, in particular fever, asthma and pneumonia. The studies
      investigating HSPM revealed an association with maternal alcohol consumption,
      infantile fever and ethnicity. However, the validity of these findings is
      impaired by study design, lack of adjustment for confounders, lack of detail and 
      consistency of exposures investigated and poor reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood 
      illness is likely to be associated with MIH. Further prospective studies of the
      etiology of MIH/HSPM are needed.

TI  - Childhood asthma and physical activity: a systematic review with meta-analysis
      and Graphic Appraisal Tool for Epidemiology assessment.
PG  - 50

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma is a global problem affecting the respiratory health
      of children. Physical activity (PA) plays a role in the relationship between
      asthma and respiratory health. We hypothesized that a low level of PA would be
      associated with asthma in children and adolescents. The objectives of our study
      were to (1) summarize the evidence available on associations between PA and
      asthma prevalence in children and adolescents and (2) assess the role of PA in
      new-onset or incident asthma among children and adolescents. METHODS: We searched
      Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Embase and extracted data from original
      articles that met the inclusion criteria. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and
      confidence intervals (CIs) were used to express the results of the meta-analysis 
      (forest plot). We explored heterogeneity using funnel plots and the Graphic
      Appraisal Tool for Epidemiology (GATE). RESULTS: We retrieved 1,571 titles and
      selected 11 articles describing three cohort and eight cross-sectional studies
      for inclusion. A meta-analysis of the cohort studies revealed a risk of new-onset
      asthma in children with low PA (OR [95 % CI] 1.32 [0.95; 1.84] [random effects]
      and 1.35 [1.13; 1.62] [fixed effects]). Three cross-sectional studies identified 
      significant positive associations between childhood asthma or asthma symptoms and
      low PA. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with low PA levels had an increased
      risk of new-onset asthma, and some had a higher risk of current asthma/or
      wheezing; however, there was some heterogeneity among the studies. This review
      reveals a critical need for future longitudinal assessments of low PA, its
      mechanisms, and its implications for incident asthma in children. The systematic 
      review was prospectively registered at PROSPERO (registration number:
      CRD42014013761; available at: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO [accessed: 24
      March 2016]).

TI  - Breathing exercises for children with asthma.
PG  - CD011017
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD011017.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. Breathing
      exercise techniques have been widely used by researchers and professionals in the
      search for complementary therapies for the treatment of asthma. OBJECTIVES: To
      assess the effects of breathing exercises in children with asthma. SEARCH
      METHODS: We searched for trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
      Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and AMED and handsearched
      respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. We also consulted trial registers and
      reference lists of included articles.The literature search was run up to
      September 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials of
      breathing exercises alone versus control or breathing exercises as part of a more
      complex intervention versus control in children with asthma. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted
      data. The primary outcomes were quality of life, asthma symptoms and serious
      adverse events. The secondary outcomes were reduction in medication usage, number
      of acute exacerbations, physiological measures (lung function (especially low
      flow rates) and functional capacity), days off school and adverse events. MAIN
      RESULTS: The review included three studies involving 112 participants. All the
      included studies performed the comparison breathing exercises as part of a more
      complex intervention versus control. There were no trials comparing breathing
      exercises alone with control. Asthma severity of participants from the included
      studies varied. The studies measured: quality of life, asthma symptoms, reduction
      in medication usage, number of acute exacerbations and lung function. Breathing
      exercise techniques used by the included studies consisted of lateral costal
      breathing, diaphragmatic breathing, inspiratory patterns and pursed lips. One
      study included in the review did not specify the type of breathing exercise used.
      The control groups received different interventions: one received placebo
      treatment, one an educational programme and doctor appointments, and one was not 
      described. There were no reported between-group comparisons for any of the
      primary outcomes. We judged the included studies as having an unclear risk of
      bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We could draw no reliable conclusions concerning the 
      use of breathing exercises for children with asthma in clinical practice. The
      breathing exercises were part of a more comprehensive package of care, and could 
      not be assessed on their own. Moreover, there were methodological differences
      among the three small included studies and poor reporting of methodological
      aspects and results in most of the included studies.

TI  - The role of the PM2.5-associated metals in pathogenesis of child Mycoplasma
      Pneumoniae infections: a systematic review.
PG  - 10604-10614
LID - 10.1007/s11356-016-6535-2 [doi]
AB  - The peak occurrence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) infections in
      childhood and haze episodes is concurrent. Together, the prevalence of
      macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae varies among countries might also be related to
      the concentration of ambient fine particulate mass (aerodynamic diameter </=2.5
      mum, PM2.5). Numerous cohort studies have identified consistent associations
      between ambient PM2.5 and cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. PM2.5 is a
      carrier of the heavy metals. The relationship between PM2.5-associated metals and
      M. pneumoniae infections in childhood has been increasingly drawing public
      attention. First, we reviewed original articles and review papers in Pubmed and
      Web of Science regarding M. pneumoniae and PM2.5-associated metal and analyzed
      the structural basis of PM2.5-associated metal interaction with M. pneumoniae.
      Then, the possible mechanisms of action between them were conjectured. Mechanisms
      of oxidative stress induction and modulation of the host immune system and
      inflammatory responses via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and/or the nuclear
      factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway are postulated to be the result of
      PM2.5-associated metal complex interaction with M. pneumoniae. In addition, a
      heavy metal effect on M. pneumoniae-expressed community-acquired respiratory
      distress syndrome (CARDS) toxin, and activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 
      (AhR) and TLRs to induce the differentiation of T helper (Th) cells are also
      regarded as important reasons for the influence of the heavy metals on the
      severity of M. pneumoniae pneumonia and the initial onset and exacerbation of M. 
      pneumoniae associated asthma. PM2.5-associated metals via complex mechanisms can 
      exert a great impact on the host through interaction with M. pneumoniae.

TI  - A systematic review of fractional exhaled nitric oxide in the routine management 
      of childhood asthma.
PG  - 316-28
LID - 10.1002/ppul.23371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a non-invasive biomarker of
      eosinophilic inflammation which may be used to guide the management of asthma in 
      childhood. OBJECTIVES: To synthesise the available evidence on the efficacy of
      FeNO-guided management of childhood asthma. METHODS: Databases including MEDLINE 
      and the Cochrane Library were searched, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
      comparing FeNO-guided management with any other monitoring strategy were
      included. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for
      RCTs, and a number of outcomes were examined, including: exacerbations,
      medication use, quality of life, adverse events, and other markers of asthma
      control. Meta-analyses were planned if multiple studies with suitable
      heterogeneity were available. However, due to wide variations in study
      characteristics, meta-analysis was not possible. RESULTS: Seven RCTs were
      identified. There was some evidence that FeNO-guided monitoring results in
      improved asthma control during the first year of management, although few results
      attained statistical significance. The impact on severe exacerbations was
      unclear. Similarly, the impact on use of anti-asthmatic drugs was unclear, and
      appears to depend on the step up/down protocols, and the clinical characteristics
      of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefit of FeNO monitoring is equivocal. 
      Trends toward reduced exacerbation and increased medication use were seen, but
      typically failed to reach statistical significance. There are a number of issues 
      that complicate data interpretation, including differences in the likely severity
      of included cohorts and variations in treatment algorithms. Further work is
      needed to systematically explore the impact of these parameters.

      randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 128-43
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.115.111104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is some evidence that increased maternal intake of omega-3
      (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) during pregnancy may
      reduce the incidence of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic disease.
      OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate prenatal n-3 LC-PUFA dietary exposure in
      observational studies and n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation in randomized controlled
      trials (RCTs) on outcomes of IgE-mediated allergic disease. DESIGN: We conducted 
      searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Ovid
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science to 30 July 2015. We included 
      prospective cohort studies that showed an association between maternal fish or
      n-3 LC-PUFA intake during pregnancy and RCTs with a prenatal intervention to
      modify maternal n-3 LC-PUFA intake and outcomes of allergic disease (eczema,
      rhino-conjunctivitis, asthma) or sensitization in the offspring. RESULTS: A total
      of 13 publications from 10 prospective cohort studies and 7 publications
      representing 5 unique RCTs were included. Three RCTs were combined in a
      meta-analysis for selected outcomes. Nine of 13 observational study publications 
      and 5 of 7 publications from RCTs found a protective association between
      increased prenatal n-3 LC-PUFA or fish intake and incidence of allergic disease
      symptoms in the child. Meta-analysis was limited because of the heterogeneity of 
      the RCTs. Pooled results showed a significant reduction in the incidence of
      "atopic eczema," "any positive SPT [skin-prick test]," "sensitization to egg,"
      and "sensitization to any food" in the first 12 mo of life [RRs (95% CIs): 0.53
      (0.35, 0.81), P = 0.004; 0.68 (0.52-0.89), P = 0.006; 0.55 (0.39-0.76), P =
      0.0004; and 0.59 (0.46, 0.76), P < 0.0001, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      systematic review and meta-analysis was suggestive of benefits of increased n-3
      LC-PUFAs in the maternal diet and outcomes of childhood allergic disease.
      However, due to the inconsistency in results, the hypothesis linking maternal n-3
      LC-PUFA intake to childhood allergic disease cannot unequivocally be confirmed or
      rejected.

AB  - Early identification of children at risk of developing asthma at school age is
      crucial, but the usefulness of childhood asthma prediction models in clinical
      practice is still unclear. We systematically reviewed all existing prediction
      models to identify preschool children with asthma-like symptoms at risk of
      developing asthma at school age. Studies were included if they developed a new
      prediction model or updated an existing model in children aged 4 years or younger
      with asthma-like symptoms, with assessment of asthma done between 6 and 12 years 
      of age. 12 prediction models were identified in four types of cohorts of
      preschool children: those with health-care visits, those with parent-reported
      symptoms, those at high risk of asthma, or children in the general population.
      Four basic models included non-invasive, easy-to-obtain predictors only, notably 
      family history, allergic disease comorbidities or precursors of asthma, and
      severity of early symptoms. Eight extended models included additional clinical
      tests, mostly specific IgE determination. Some models could better predict asthma
      development and other models could better rule out asthma development, but the
      predictive performance of no single model stood out in both aspects
      simultaneously. This finding suggests that there is a large proportion of
      preschool children with wheeze for which prediction of asthma development is
      difficult.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Factors at multiple ecological levels, including the child, family,
      home, medical care, and community, impact adolescent asthma outcomes. OBJECTIVE: 
      This systematic review characterizes behavioral interventions at the child,
      family, home, medical system, and community level to improve asthma management
      among adolescents. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, SCOPUS, OVID,
      PsycINFO, CINAHL, and reference review databases was conducted from January 1,
      2000, through August 10, 2014. Articles were included if the title or abstract
      included asthma AND intervention AND (education OR self-management OR behavioral 
      OR technology OR trigger reduction), and the mean and/or median age of
      participants was between 11 and 16 years. We compared populations, intervention
      characteristics, study designs, outcomes, settings, and intervention levels
      across studies to evaluate behavioral interventions to improve asthma management 
      for adolescents. RESULTS: Of 1230 articles identified and reviewed, 24 articles
      (21 unique studies) met inclusion criteria. Promising approaches to improving
      adherence to daily controller medications include objective monitoring of inhaled
      corticosteroid adherence with allergist and/or immunologist feedback on
      medication-taking behavior and school nurse directly observed therapy. Efficacy
      at increasing asthma self-management skills was demonstrated using group
      interactive learning in the school setting. This systematic review is not a
      meta-analysis, thus limiting its quantitative assessment of studies. Publication 
      bias may also limit our findings. CONCLUSIONS: Novel strategies to objectively
      increase controller medication adherence for adolescents include allergist and/or
      immunologist feedback and school nurse directly observed therapy. Schools, the
      most common setting across studies in this review, provide the opportunity for
      group interactive learning to improve asthma knowledge and self-management
      skills.

TI  - The march from early life food sensitization to allergic disease: a systematic
      review and meta-analyses of birth cohort studies.
PG  - 77-89
LID - 10.1111/all.12784 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence for an increase in food allergies. The
      question of whether early life food sensitization, a primary step in food
      allergies, leads to other allergic disease is a controversial but important
      issue. Birth cohorts are an ideal design to answer this question. OBJECTIVES: We 
      aimed to systematically investigate and meta-analyse the evidence for
      associations between early food sensitization and allergic disease in birth
      cohorts. METHODS: MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases were searched for birth cohorts
      that have investigated the association between food sensitization in the first 2 
      years and subsequent wheeze/asthma, eczema and/or allergic rhinitis. We performed
      meta-analyses using random-effects models to obtain pooled estimates, stratified 
      by age group. RESULTS: The search yielded fifteen original articles representing 
      thirteen cohorts. Early life food sensitization was associated with an increased 
      risk of infantile eczema, childhood wheeze/asthma, eczema and allergic rhinitis
      and young adult asthma. Meta-analyses demonstrated that early life food
      sensitization is related to an increased risk of wheeze/asthma (pooled OR 2.9;
      95% CI 2.0-4.0), eczema (pooled OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.7-4.4) and allergic rhinitis
      (pooled OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.9-4.9) from 4 to 8 years. CONCLUSION: Food sensitization
      in the first 2 years of life can identify children at high risk of subsequent
      allergic disease who may benefit from early life preventive strategies. However, 
      due to potential residual confounding in the majority of studies combined with
      lack of follow-up into adolescence and adulthood, further research is needed.

AB  - Asthma is one of the most common respiratory diseases affecting all age groups.
      The world is now trying to identify some dietary factors which can play a
      preventive role. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to
      assess the effect of intake of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in infancy
      and/or childhood on incidence of asthma or wheezing episodes. We searched
      MEDLINE, EBSCO, Trip, and Google Scholar up to January 31, 2015. All RCTs where
      infants or children who were given omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and which
      reported incidence of asthma and/or wheezing episodes as dichotomous outcomes
      were included in this review. Random effects model was used for pooling the risk 
      estimates. Total five articles were included. Most of them were from Australia.
      On meta-analysis, the pooled estimate of odds ratios by random effects model
      showed no significant change in incidence of asthma after supplementation of
      omega-3 FA in infancy or childhood (OR 0.974; CI 0.646, 1.469; p = 0.900). We
      concluded that a multicentric RCT is required to assess the effect of omega-3 FA 
      supplementation exclusively to infants or children to predict the best time of
      omega-3 FA supplementation to prevent asthmatic or wheezing episodes later in
      life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of socioeconomic disadvantage with the
      prevalence of childhood disabling chronic conditions in high-income countries.
      STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES: 6 electronic
      databases, relevant websites, reference lists and experts in the field. STUDY
      SELECTION: 160 observational studies conducted in high-income countries with data
      on socioeconomic status and disabling chronic conditions in childhood, published 
      between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 2013. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS:
      Abstracts were reviewed, full papers obtained, and papers identified for
      inclusion by 2 independent reviewers. Inclusion decisions were checked by a third
      reviewer. Where reported, ORs were extracted for low versus high socioeconomic
      status. For studies reporting raw data but not ORs, ORs were calculated.
      Narrative analysis was undertaken for studies without data suitable for
      meta-analysis. RESULTS: 126 studies had data suitable for meta-analysis. ORs for 
      risk estimates were: all-cause disabling chronic conditions 1.72 (95% CI 1.48 to 
      2.01); psychological disorders 1.88 (95% CI 1.68 to 2.10); intellectual
      disability 2.41 (95% CI 2.03 to 2.86); activity-limiting asthma 2.20 (95% CI 1.87
      to 2.85); cerebral palsy 1.42 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.61); congenital abnormalities
      1.41 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.61); epilepsy 1.38 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.59); sensory
      impairment 1.70 (95% CI 1.39 to 2.07). Heterogeneity was high across most
      estimates (I(2)>75%). Of the 34 studies without data suitable for meta-analysis, 
      26 reported results consistent with increased risk associated with low
      socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that, in high-income
      countries, childhood disabling chronic conditions are associated with social
      disadvantage. Although evidence of an association is consistent across different 
      countries, the review provides limited evidence to explain the association;
      future research, using longitudinal data, will be required to distinguish low
      socioeconomic status as the cause or consequence of childhood disabling chronic
      conditions and the aetiological pathways and mechanisms.

TI  - Vitamin D Supplementation for Childhood Asthma: A Systematic Review and
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e0136841
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0136841 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: There is growing evidence that vitamin D plays a role in the
      pathogenesis of asthma but it is unclear whether supplementation during childhood
      may improve asthma outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review 
      and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vitamin D
      supplementation as a treatment or adjunct treatment for asthma. DATA SOURCES: We 
      searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL through July 2014. STUDY SELECTION:
      We included RCTs that evaluated vitamin D supplementation in children versus
      active control or placebo for asthma. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: One reviewer
      extracted data and one reviewer verified data accuracy. We qualitatively
      summarized the main results of efficacy and safety and meta-analyzed data on
      comparable outcomes across studies. We used GRADE for strength of evidence. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Main planned outcomes measures were ED visits and
      hospitalizations. As secondary outcomes, we examined measures of asthma control, 
      including frequency of asthma exacerbations, asthma symptom scores, measures of
      lung function, beta2-agonist use and daily steroid use, adverse events and
      25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. RESULTS: Eight RCTs (one parallel, one crossover
      design) comprising 573 children aged 3 to 18 years were included. One study
      (moderate-quality, n = 100) reported significantly less ED visits for children
      treated with vitamin D. No other studies examined the primary outcome (ED visits 
      and hospitalizations). There was a reduced risk of asthma exacerbations in
      children receiving vitamin D (low-quality; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.63, 3
      studies, n = 378). There was no significant effect for asthma symptom scores and 
      lung function. The serum 25(OH)D level was higher in the vitamin D group at the
      end of the intervention (low-quality; MD 19.66 nmol/L, 95% CI 5.96 nmol/L to
      33.37 nmol/L, 5 studies, n = 167). LIMITATIONS: We identified a high degree of
      clinical diversity (interventions and outcomes) and methodological heterogeneity 
      (sample size and risk of bias) in included trials. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
      Randomized controlled trials provide some low-quality evidence to support vitamin
      D supplementation for the reduction of asthma exacerbations. Evidence on the
      benefits of vitamin D supplementation for other asthma-related outcomes in
      children is either limited or inconclusive. We recommend that future trials focus
      on patient-relevant outcomes that are comparable across studies, including
      standardized definitions of asthma exacerbations.

TI  - Vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of childhood acute respiratory
      infections: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 1026-34
LID - 10.1017/S000711451500207X [doi]
AB  - Results from recent trials assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on
      the prevention of childhood acute respiratory infections (ARI) have been
      inconsistent. In the present study, we determined whether vitamin D
      supplementation prevents ARI in healthy children and repeated infections in
      children with previous ARI. We conducted a systematic literature search using
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The
      search included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCT) comparing
      vitamin D supplementation with either placebo or no intervention in children
      younger than 18 years of age. We identified seven RCT and found that the summary 
      estimates were not statistically significantly associated with a reduction in the
      risk of ARI (relative risk (RR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.55, 1.13), all-cause mortality (RR
      1.18, 95% CI 0.71, 1.94), or the rate of hospital admission due to respiratory
      infection in healthy children (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72, 1.26). However, in children 
      previously diagnosed with asthma, vitamin D supplementation resulted in a 74%
      reduction in the risk of asthma exacerbation (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11, 0.59; test of
      heterogeneity, I 2= 0.0%). Our findings indicate a lack of evidence supporting
      the routine use of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of ARI in healthy
      children; however, they suggest that such supplementation may benefit children
      previously diagnosed with asthma. Due to the heterogeneity of the included
      studies and possible publication biases related to this field, these results
      should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and risk of asthma, wheeze, and atopic
      diseases during childhood: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1588-604
LID - 10.1111/all.12729 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies suggest a relationship between maternal
      nutrition during pregnancy and the occurrence of asthma and atopic conditions
      during childhood. However, individual study results are conflicting. The
      objective of this meta-analysis was to critically examine the current evidence
      for an association between nutrition (dietary patterns, food groups, vitamins, or
      oligo-elements) ingestion during pregnancy and asthma, wheeze, or atopic
      conditions in childhood. METHODS: The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i)
      systematic recording of diet during the gestational period and (ii) documentation
      of asthma, wheezing, eczema, or other atopic disease in the offspring. The
      primary outcomes were prevalence of asthma or wheeze among the offspring during
      childhood; and secondary outcomes were prevalence of eczema, allergic rhinitis,
      or other atopic conditions. RESULTS: We found 120 titles, abstracts, and
      citations, and 32 studies (29 cohorts) were included in this analysis. Data on
      vitamins, oligo-elements, food groups, and dietary patterns during pregnancy were
      collected. A meta-analysis revealed that higher maternal intake of vitamin D
      [odds ratio (OR) = 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.38-0.88], vitamin E (OR
      = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.46-0.78), and zinc (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40-0.97) was
      associated with lower odds of wheeze during childhood. However, none of these or 
      other nutrients was consistently associated with asthma per se or other atopic
      conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests a protective effect of
      maternal intake of each of three vitamins or nutrients (vitamin D, vitamin E, and
      zinc) against childhood wheeze but is inconclusive for an effect on asthma or
      other atopic conditions.

LID - 10.1111/all.12700 [doi]
AB  - Growing evidence underlines the pivotal role of infant gut colonization in the
      development of the immune system. The possibility to modify gut colonization
      through probiotic supplementation in childhood might prevent atopic diseases. The
      aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect
      of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and early infancy in preventing
      atopic diseases. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized
      controlled trials evaluating the use of probiotics during pregnancy or early
      infancy for prevention of allergic diseases. Fixed-effect models were used, and
      random-effects models where significant heterogeneity was present. Results were
      expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Seventeen
      studies, reporting data from 4755 children (2381 in the probiotic group and 2374 
      in the control group), were included in the meta-analysis. Infants treated with
      probiotics had a significantly lower RR for eczema compared to controls (RR 0.78 
      [95% CI: 0.69-0.89], P = 0.0003), especially those supplemented with a mixture of
      probiotics (RR 0.54 [95% CI: 0.43-0.68], P < 0.00001). No significant difference 
      in terms of prevention of asthma (RR 0.99 [95% CI: 0.77-1.27], P = 0.95),
      wheezing (RR 1.02 [95% CI: 0.89-1.17], P = 0.76) or rhinoconjunctivitis (RR 0.91 
      [95% CI: 0.67-1.23], P = 0.53) was documented. The results of the present
      meta-analysis show that probiotic supplementation prevents infantile eczema, thus
      suggesting a new potential indication for probiotic use in pregnancy and infancy.

TI  - Maternal prenatal and/or postnatal n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (LCPUFA) supplementation for preventing allergies in early childhood.
PG  - CD010085
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010085.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergies have become more prevalent globally over the last 20 years.
      Dietary consumption of n-3 (or omega 3) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (LCPUFA) has declined over the same period of time. This, together with the known
      role of n-3 LCPUFA in inhibiting inflammation, has resulted in speculation that
      n-3 LCPUFA may prevent allergy development. Dietary n-3 fatty acids supplements
      may change the developing immune system of the newborn before allergic responses 
      are established, particularly for those with a genetic predisposition to the
      production of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody. Individuals with IgE-mediated 
      allergies have both the signs and symptoms of the allergic disease and a positive
      skin prick test (SPT) to the allergen. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of n-3
      LCPUFA supplementation in pregnant and/or breastfeeding women on allergy outcomes
      (food allergy, atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and
      asthma/wheeze) in their children. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane
      Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (6 August 2014), PubMed (1966 to
      01 August 2014), CINAHL via EBSCOhost (1984 to 01 August 2014), Scopus (1995 to
      01 August 2014), Web of Knowledge (1864 to 01 August 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov
      (01 August 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We
      included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of n-3 LCPUFA 
      supplementation of pregnant and/or lactating women (compared with placebo or no
      treatment) on allergy outcomes of the infants or children. Trials using a
      cross-over design and trials examining biochemical outcomes only were not
      eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors
      independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and performed data
      extraction. Where the review authors were also investigators on trials selected, 
      an independent reviewer assessed trial quality and performed data extraction.
      MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials involving 3366 women and their 3175 children were
      included in the review. In these trials, women were supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA 
      during pregnancy (five trials), lactation (two trials) or both pregnancy and
      lactation (one trial). All trials randomly allocated women to either a n-3 LCPUFA
      supplement or a control group. The risk of bias varied across the eight included 
      trials in this review with only two trials with a low risk of selection,
      performance and attrition bias.N-3 LCPUFA supplementation showed a clear
      reduction in the primary outcome of any allergy (medically diagnosed IgE
      mediated) in children aged 12 to 36 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.98; two RCTs; 823 children), but not beyond 36 months (RR
      0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.20; one RCT, 706 children). For any allergy (medically
      diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report), no clear differences were seen in
      children either at 12 to 36 months (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; two RCTs, 823
      children) or beyond 36 months of age (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; three RCTs,
      1765 children).For the secondary outcomes of specific allergies there were no
      clear differences for food allergies at 12 to 36 months and beyond 36 months, but
      a clear reduction was seen for children in their first 12 months with n-3 LCPUFA 
      (both for medically diagnosed IgE mediated and medically diagnosed IgE mediated
      and/or parental report). There was a clear reduction in medically diagnosed
      IgE-mediated eczema with n-3 LCPUFA for children 12 to 36 months of age, but not 
      at any other time point for both medically diagnosed IgE mediated and medically
      diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report. No clear differences for allergic 
      rhinitis or asthma/wheeze were seen at any time point for both medically
      diagnosed IgE mediated, and medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental
      report.There was a clear reduction in children's sensitisation to egg and
      sensitisation to any allergen between 12 to 36 months of age when mothers were
      supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA.In terms of safety for the mother and child, n-3
      LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy did not show increased risk of postpartum
      haemorrhage or early childhood infections. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there
      is limited evidence to support maternal n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during
      pregnancy and/or lactation for reducing allergic disease in children. Few
      differences in childhood allergic disease were seen between women who were
      supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA and those who were not.

PG  - 38-53
LID - 10.1111/apa.13132 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To systematically review the association between breastfeeding and childhood
      allergic disease. METHODS: Predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria identified 
      89 articles from PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE databases. Meta-analyses performed for
      categories of breastfeeding and allergic outcomes. Meta-regression explored
      heterogeneity. RESULTS: More vs. less breastfeeding (duration) was associated
      with reduced risk of asthma for children (5-18 years), particularly in
      medium-/low-income countries and with reduced risk of allergic rhinitis </=5
      years, but this estimate had high heterogeneity and low quality. Exclusive
      breastfeeding for 3-4 months was associated with reduced risk of eczema </=2
      years (estimate principally from cross-sectional studies of low methodological
      quality). No association found between breastfeeding and food allergy (estimate
      had high heterogeneity and low quality). Meta-regression found differences
      between study outcomes may be attributable to length of breastfeeding recall,
      study design, country income and date of study inception. Some of the protective 
      effect of breastfeeding for asthma may be related to recall bias in studies of
      lesser methodological quality. CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that
      breastfeeding is protective for asthma (5-18 years). There is weaker evidence for
      a protective effect for eczema </=2 years and allergic rhinitis </=5 years of
      age, with greater protection for asthma and eczema in low-income countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is a common chronic disease, which can affect patients at any 
      age. Recently, cluster analyses have suggested that patients with asthma can be
      divided into different phenotypes and that the age at the onset of the disease is
      a critical defining factor. The prognosis of allergic childhood-onset asthma is
      relatively well known, whereas the prognosis of adult-onset asthma remains
      unclear. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review to identify studies that
      evaluated the long-term prognosis of new-onset asthma diagnosed at adult age.
      Criteria used (set 1) were: 1. adult-onset asthma, 2. physician diagnosed asthma 
      (including objective lung-functions) < 1 year before the first visit, 3.
      follow-up time of at least 5 years, 4. objective lung function measurements used 
      at follow-up and 5. not a comparative trial. Another set of studies (set 2) with 
      less strict criteria were gathered. RESULTS: The main result of this systematic
      review is that the amount of evidence on the prognosis of new-onset asthma
      diagnosed at adult age is very limited. Only one study (n = 250) fulfilled the
      criteria (set 1) and it suggests that the five-year prognosis of new-onset asthma
      diagnosed at adult age may not be favorable, the proportion of patients being in 
      remission was less than 5%. Furthermore, six additional follow-up studies (n =
      964) were identified including mainly patients with adult-onset asthma (set 2).
      These studies had variable endpoints and the results could not be combined.
      CONCLUSION: Further follow-up studies that recruit patients with new-onset adult 
      asthma are needed to understand the prognostic factors in adult-onset asthma.

TI  - Adverse childhood experience and asthma onset: a systematic review.
PG  - 299-305
LID - 10.1183/16000617.00004114 [doi]
AB  - Adverse childhood experiences such as abuse and neglect are associated with
      subsequent immune dysregulation. Some studies show an association between adverse
      childhood experiences and asthma onset, although significant disparity in results
      exists in the published literature. We aimed to review available studies
      employing a prospective design that investigates associations between adverse
      childhood experience and asthma. A search protocol was developed and studies were
      drawn from four electronic journal databases. Studies were selected in accordance
      with pre-set inclusion criteria and relevant data were extracted. 12 studies,
      assessing data from a total of 31 524 individuals, were identified that
      investigate the impact of a range of adverse childhood experiences on the
      likelihood of developing asthma. Evidence suggests that chronic stress exposure
      and maternal distress in pregnancy operate synergistically with known triggers
      such as traffic-related air pollution to increase asthma risk. Chronic stress in 
      early life is associated with an increased risk of asthma onset. There is
      evidence that adverse childhood experience increases the impact of
      traffic-related air pollution and inconsistent evidence that adverse childhood
      experience has an independent effect on asthma onset.

TI  - The immunomodulatory effect of acupoint application for childhood asthma: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 896247
LID - 10.1155/2015/896247 [doi]
AB  - Objective. To evaluate the evidence on the immunomodulatory effect of acupoint
      application for childhood asthma. Methods. Five electronic databases through
      October 2014 were searched. The risk of bias in eligible studies was assessed
      using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) of random-effects model were calculated. And
      heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q statistic and quantified with the 
      I (2) index. Results. Six studies were included in our review. The aggregated
      results suggested that acupoint application showed the beneficial effect for
      childhood asthma in improving IgA (SMD, -0.83; 95% CI -1.14 to -0.52; P <
      0.00001), IgE (SMD, -0.52; 95% CI -0.76 to -0.29; P < 0.001), IgG (SMD, -1.17;
      95% CI -1.61 to -0.74; P < 0.0001), IL-4 (SMD, -0.57; 95% CI -0.91 to -0.23; P = 
      0.0009), and IFN-gamma (SMD, -0.38; 95% CI -0.71 to -0.04; P = 0.03) but not IgM 
      (SMD, -0.40; 95% CI -0.98 to 0.18; P = 0.18). And the effective dose of acupoint 
      application may be 2-6 hours/time and a total of 3 times within 4 weeks.
      Conclusions. This review showed the positive evidence that acupoint application
      had the favorable immunomodulatory effect for childhood asthma. However, more
      studies with long follow-up are warrant to confirm the current findings.

TI  - Updated prevalences of asthma, allergy, and airway symptoms, and a systematic
      review of trends over time for childhood asthma in Shanghai, China.
PG  - e0121577
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0121577 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of asthma among Shanghai children has increased over
      time. This increase might be associated with changes in environmental exposures. 
      Investigation of the time-trend of asthma and current prevalences is essential to
      understanding the causes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the current prevalences of
      asthma, allergies and other respiratory symptoms among Shanghai preschool
      children, and to investigate the time-trend of childhood asthma prevalence of
      from 1990 to 2011. METHODS: From April 2011 to April 2012, the CCHH (China,
      Children, Homes, Health) cross-sectional study was conducted in Shanghai.
      Questionnaires were distributed to 17,898 parents or guardians of preschool
      children from 72 kindergartens in 5 districts. Previous similar studies were also
      summarized by a systematic literature review. RESULTS: From a total of 14,884
      questionnaires for 3-7 year old children, prevalences of the following diseases
      and symptoms were calculated: asthma 10.2%, wheeze (ever) 28.1%, pneumonia (ever)
      33.5%, otitis media 11.0%, rhinitis (ever) 54.1%, hay fever 12.2%, eczema (ever) 
      22.7%, and food allergy 15.7%. Urban children had higher prevalences of most
      symptoms than suburban children. The prevalence of asthma has increased
      significantly, almost five-fold, from 2.1% in 1990 to 10.2% in the present study.
      The prevalence of asthma in boys was higher than in girls in the present study
      and in all reviewed studies. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma, allergy and airway symptoms are
      common among preschool children in Shanghai. The prevalence of childhood asthma
      in Shanghai has increased rapidly from 1990 to 2011.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether children conceived by assisted reproductive
      technology are at increased risk of somatic morbidity in childhood compared with 
      spontaneously conceived children. DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING: None.
      PATIENT(S): Children conceived by assisted reproductive technology and reference 
      groups of spontaneously conceived children or children from the background
      population. INTERVENTION(S): Medline/Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library
      were searched as well as reference lists of the retrieved relevant studies. Only 
      cohort studies and case-control studies were included. All studies were scored
      using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to assess study quality and the risk of bias in 
      the individual studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Postneonatal somatic diseases,
      health care use, chronic illnesses (unspecified), surgery, use of medication, and
      mortality. RESULT(S): Thirty-eight studies were included. Results indicated that 
      children conceived by assisted reproductive technology may be at increased risk
      of unspecified infectious and parasitic diseases, asthma, genitourinary diseases,
      epilepsy or convulsions, and longer hospitalizations. However, several results in
      individual studies were not statistically significant and some inconsistency
      existed between study results. No differences between groups were found regarding
      hospital admission, outpatient visits, or use of medication. Results regarding
      mortality, unspecified cancer, pneumonia, allergy, respiratory, and
      gastrointestinal diseases were contradictory. When considering only the 13
      studies allocated the highest score on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, similar
      results were found. CONCLUSION(S): Children conceived by assisted reproductive
      technology may be at increased risk of somatic morbidity in childhood compared
      with spontaneously conceived children, although some inconsistency exists between
      study results.

TI  - Birth weight and childhood wheezing disorders: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 500-8
LID - 10.1136/jech-2014-204783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies have claimed that birth weight and
      childhood wheezing disorders are associated although the results remained
      inconsistent. One systematic review and two systematic reviews that included
      meta-analyses reported inconsistent results. We aimed to conduct a systematic
      review and meta-analysis to investigate this. METHODS: An online search of
      published papers linking childhood asthma and wheezing disorders with birth
      weight up to February 2014 was carried out using EMBASE and Medline medical
      research databases. Summary ORs were estimated using random-effects models.
      Subgroup meta-analyses were performed to assess the robustness of risk
      associations and between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 37 studies
      comprising 1,71, 737 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The
      unadjusted summary ORs for risk of childhood wheezing disorders associated with
      low birth weight (<2.5 kg) were 1.60 (95% CI 1.39 to 1.85, p<0.001) and 1.37 (95%
      CI 1.05 to 1.79, p=0.02) when compared with >/=2.5 and 2.5-4.0 kg birthweight
      groups, respectively. The overall summary OR for high birth weight (>4 kg) as
      compared to the 2.5-4.0 kg birthweight group was 1.02 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.04,
      p=0.13). There was substantial heterogeneity in the unadjusted low birth weight
      risk estimates which was not accounted for by predefined study characteristics.
      There was no significant heterogeneity in the high birth weight risk estimates.
      There was some evidence of funnel plot asymmetry and small study effects in the
      low birth weight (2.5 vs >/=2.5 kg and <2.5 vs 2.5-4 kg) OR estimates.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that low birth (<2.5 kg) is an independent risk 
      factor for wheezing disorders during childhood and adolescence although there was
      substantial heterogeneity among the risk estimates. However, we found no
      significant association of high birth weight with wheezing disorders.

TI  - The influence of childhood traffic-related air pollution exposure on asthma,
      allergy and sensitization: a systematic review and a meta-analysis of birth
      cohort studies.
PG  - 245-56
LID - 10.1111/all.12561 [doi]
AB  - The impact of early childhood traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure on
      development of asthma and allergies remains unclear. Birth cohort studies are the
      best available study design to answer this question, but the evidence from such
      studies has not been synthesized to date. We conducted a systematic review and
      meta-analyses of published birth cohort studies to understand the association
      between early childhood TRAP exposure, and subsequent asthma, allergies and
      sensitization. Increased longitudinal childhood exposure to PM2.5 and black
      carbon was associated with increasing risk of subsequent asthma in childhood
      (PM2.5 : OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.30 per 2 mug/m(3) and black carbon: OR 1.20,
      95%CI 1.05 to 1.38 per 1 x 10(-5) m(-1) ). Also, early childhood exposure to TRAP
      was associated with development of asthma across childhood up to 12 years of age.
      The magnitude of these associations increased with age, and the pattern was
      prominent for PM2.5 . Increasing exposure to PM2.5 was associated with
      sensitization to both aero- and food allergens. There was some evidence that TRAP
      was associated with eczema and hay fever. In summary, exposure to TRAP was
      related to asthma and allergic diseases. However, the substantial variability
      across studies warrants long-term birth cohort studies with regular repeated
      follow-ups to confirm these findings.

LID - 10.1111/pai.12321 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been claimed that overweight/obesity, childhood asthma and
      wheezing disorders are associated, although the results of observational studies 
      have remained inconsistent. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to
      investigate this. METHODS: An online search of published papers linking childhood
      asthma and wheezing with overweight/obesity up to May 2014 using EMBASE and
      MEDLINE medical research databases was carried out. Summary odds ratios (OR) were
      estimated using random-effects models. Subgroup meta-analyses were performed to
      assess the robustness of risk associations and between-study heterogeneity.
      RESULTS: A total of 38 studies comprising 1,411,335 participants were included in
      our meta-analysis. The summary ORs of underweight (<5th percentile), overweight
      (>85th to <95th percentile) and obesity (>/= 95 th percentile) were 0.85 (95% CI:
      0.75 to 0.97; p = 0.02), 1.23 (95% CI: 1.17 to 1.29; p < 0.001) and 1.46 (95% CI:
      1.36 to 1.57, p < 0.001), respectively. Heterogeneity was significant and
      substantial in all three weight categories, and not accounted for by pre-defined 
      study characteristics. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that underweight is
      associated with a reduced risk of childhood asthma, and overweight and obesity
      are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. Although our findings 
      assert that overweight/obesity and childhood asthma are associated, the causal
      pathway and temporal aspects of this relationship remain unanswered and deserve
      further epidemiological investigation.

TI  - Paracetamol exposure in pregnancy and early childhood and development of
      childhood asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 81-9
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2012-303043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: While paracetamol exposure in pregnancy and early
      infancy has been associated with asthma, it remains unclear whether this is
      confounded by respiratory tract infections, which have been suggested as an
      alternative explanation. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of
      longitudinal studies that reported the association between paracetamol exposure
      during pregnancy or infancy and the subsequent development of childhood asthma
      (>/=5 years). METHODS: Two independent researchers searched the databases EMBASE 
      and PUBMED on 12 August 2013 for relevant articles using predefined inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed and results were pooled using
      fixed effect models or random effect models when moderate between-study
      heterogeneity was observed. We explicitly assessed whether the observed
      associations are due to confounding by respiratory tract infections. RESULTS:
      Eleven observational cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Any paracetamol
      use during the first trimester was related to increased risk of childhood asthma 
      (5 studies, pooled OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.91) but there was marked
      between-study heterogeneity (I(2)=63%) and only one of these studies adjusted for
      maternal respiratory tract infections. Increasing frequency of use of paracetamol
      during infancy was associated with increased odds of childhood asthma (3 studies,
      pooled OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.31 per doubling of days exposure), but in these 
      same three studies adjusting for respiratory tract infections reduced this
      association (OR=1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). DISCUSSION: The association during
      early pregnancy exposure was highly variable between studies and exposure during 
      infancy appears to be moderately confounded by respiratory tract infections.
      There is insufficient evidence to warrant changing guidelines on early life
      paracetamol exposure at this time.

PG  - e006554
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006554 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Childhood asthma is a complex condition where many environmental
      factors are implicated in causation. The aim of this study was to complete a
      systematic review of the literature describing associations between environmental
      exposures and the development of asthma in young children. SETTING: A systematic 
      review of the literature up to November 2013 was conducted using key words agreed
      by the research team. Abstracts were screened and potentially eligible papers
      reviewed. Papers describing associations between exposures and exacerbation of
      pre-existing asthma were not included. Papers were placed into the following
      predefined categories: secondhand smoke (SHS), inhaled chemicals, damp
      housing/mould, inhaled allergens, air pollution, domestic combustion, dietary
      exposures, respiratory virus infection and medications. PARTICIPANTS: Children
      aged up to 9 years. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Diagnosed asthma and wheeze. RESULTS:
      14,691 abstracts were identified, 207 papers reviewed and 135 included in the
      present review of which 15 were systematic reviews, 6 were meta-analyses and 14
      were intervention studies. There was consistent evidence linking exposures to
      SHS, inhaled chemicals, mould, ambient air pollutants, some deficiencies in
      maternal diet and respiratory viruses to an increased risk for asthma (OR
      typically increased by 1.5-2.0). There was less consistent evidence linking
      exposures to pets, breast feeding and infant dietary exposures to asthma risk,
      and although there were consistent associations between exposures to antibiotics 
      and paracetamol in early life, these associations might reflect reverse
      causation. There was good evidence that exposures to house dust mites (in
      isolation) was not associated with asthma risk. Evidence from observational and
      intervention studies suggest that interactions between exposures were important
      to asthma causation, where the effect size was typically 1.5-3.0. CONCLUSIONS:
      There are many publications reporting associations between environmental
      exposures and modest changes in risk for asthma in young children, and this
      review highlights the complex interactions between exposures that further
      increase risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between
      maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and development of atopic disorders 
      in childhood. METHODS: We included studies published up to August 2011 that
      assessed food-based maternal dietary interventions or that examined associations 
      between maternal dietary intake during pregnancy and/or lactation and allergic
      outcomes (eczema, asthma, hay fever, and sensitization) in their children.
      RESULTS: We included 42 studies (>40 000 children): 11 intervention studies
      (including 7 randomized control trials), 26 prospective cohort studies, 4
      retrospective cohort studies, and 1 case-control study. In the randomized control
      trials, no significant difference was noted overall in the prevalence of eczema
      and asthma in the offspring of women on diets free from common food allergens
      during pregnancy. The prospective cohorts investigated a large number of
      potential associations, but reported few significant associations between
      maternal dietary intake and development of allergy. Maternal diets rich in fruits
      and vegetables, fish, and foods containing vitamin D and Mediterranean dietary
      patterns were among the few consistent associations with lower risk for allergic 
      disease in their children. Foods associated with higher risk included vegetable
      oils and margarine, nuts, and fast food. CONCLUSION: This review did not find
      widespread or consistent links between mothers' dietary intake and atopic
      outcomes in their children. However, maternal consumption of Mediterranean
      dietary patterns, diets rich in fruits and vegetables, fish, and vitamin
      D-containing foods were suggestive of benefit, requiring further evaluation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the principal findings pertaining to most effective
      long-term pharmacologic treatment of childhood asthma. METHODS: Systematic
      reviews of randomized clinical trials (SRCTs) on pharmacologic chronic treatment 
      in children (1-18 years) with persistent asthma were retrieved through MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and CDSR (up to January2014). RESULTS: One hundred
      eighty-three SRCTs were searched from databases. Among those, 39 SRCTs were
      included: two were related to step 1, 24 to step 2, nine to steps 3 and 4, and
      four to step 5 (according with NAEPP and GINA guidelines). The methodological
      quality of these SRCTs was determined by using the AMSTAR tool. RESULTS: For step
      1: addition of ipatropium bromide to short-acting beta2-agonists does not show
      any benefit. For step 2: in preschoolers, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) reduce
      severe exacerbations and improve other clinical and lung function parameters. In 
      children, ICSs are superior to leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), cromones, 
      or xantines in reducing severe exacerbations, improving lung function and other
      clinical outcomes. Fluticasone propionate (FP) is better than beclomethasone
      dipropionate (BDP) or budesonide only for lung function; but similar to
      hydrofluoroalkane-BDP or to ciclosenide. Compared to low ICSs doses, moderate
      doses result in only better lung function, but this is not true for FP. For steps
      3 and 4: adding LTRA to ICS confers a small benefit; adding LABA improves lung
      function but does not reduce exacerbations more than double or higher ICS doses. 
      For step 5: adding omalizumab decreases exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: SRCTs are
      useful for guiding decisions in chronic childhood asthma treatment.

TI  - Exposure to 'farming' and objective markers of atopy: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 744-57
LID - 10.1111/cea.12429 [doi]
AB  - There is growing interest in the 'farm effect' on the spectrum of allergy.
      Evidence concerning the farm effect on asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis has 
      been systematically synthesized, but without a specific focus on objective
      markers of sensitization. This focus is important, as farm exposures may be
      related to allergy but not to non-allergic phenotypes of disease. We aimed to
      systematically review and meta-analyse literature that has investigated
      associations between farm exposure at any age and objective measures of atopy,
      that is serum IgE or skin prick tests results. Using predefined inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, we identified 29 articles for review. IgE levels were
      measured in either childhood or adulthood by eighteen studies, while skin prick
      testing was performed in sixteen studies. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale quality
      assessments indicated that the majority of these studies demonstrated a
      representative sample of selected participants. Due to significant heterogeneity 
      in study measures and methodology between studies, only few were meta-analysed.
      This meta-analysis showed a significant protective effect of farm exposure before
      1 year of life on allergic sensitization (OR = 0.60 [0.52-0.70]). Farm exposure
      during childhood was also associated with a reduced risk of sensitization to cat 
      or timothy (OR = 0.60 [0.51-0.70]; OR=0.46 [0.41-0.51]). Studies investigating
      the effect of farm exposure in adult life could not be meta-analysed, and their
      results were inconsistent. Insufficient studies investigated food sensitization
      as an outcome to allow synthesis. The majority of studies included in this review
      investigated childhood farm exposure, finding evidence to support a protective
      childhood 'farm effect' against subsequent atopy. There is inconsistent evidence 
      on the association between farm exposure in adulthood and allergic sensitization.
      Further studies are needed to tease out the exact exposures and timing associated
      with farming environments that protect against allergic disease.

TI  - Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and childhood allergic diseases: a systematic review.
PG  - 2-11
LID - 10.1111/pai.12281 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Studies have found a link between neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NNH)
      and/or neonatal phototherapy (NPT) and childhood allergic diseases. The present
      systematic review was conducted to provide updated evidence and to provide
      direction regarding future research. A systematic search of the published
      literature was carried out. Observational studies including children up to 12 yr 
      of age were included. Data extraction was carried out using a standardized data
      extraction form that was designed and pilot tested a priori. The analysis was
      carried out with the statistical software RevMan (version 5.2) [Protocol is
      registered at PROSPERO: CRD42014009943]. Of 79 citations retrieved, a total of 7 
      good quality studies (n = 101,499) were included in the final analysis. There was
      a significant increase in the odds of asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) after NNH
      [asthma, OR 4.26 (95% CI 4.04-4.5); AR, OR 5.37 (95% CI 4.16-6.92)] and after NPT
      [asthma, OR 3.81 (95% CI 3.53-4.11); AR, OR 3.04(95% CI 2.13-4.32)]. A similar
      increase in the trend was noted for late onset of asthma after NNH [OR 4.1 (95%
      CI 2.82-5.94)], and hospitalization due to asthma after NPT [OR 3.56 (95% CI
      2.93-4.33)]. The GRADE evidence generated was of 'low quality'. The current
      evidence finds a significant increase in the odds of childhood allergic diseases 
      after NNH and/or NPT. As observational studies were included, the evidence
      generated was of 'low quality'. Future studies should try to elucidate the
      pathophysiologic link between NNH and/or NPT and childhood allergic diseases.

PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/1742-7622-11-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study of non-atopic asthma/wheeze in children separately from
      atopic asthma is relatively recent. Studies have focused on single risk factors
      and had inconsistent findings. OBJECTIVE: To review evidence on factors
      associated with non-atopic asthma/wheeze in children and adolescents. METHODS: A 
      review of studies of risk factors for non-atopic asthma/wheeze which had a
      non-asthmatic comparison group, and assessed atopy by skin-prick test or
      allergen-specific IgE. RESULTS: Studies of non-atopic asthma/wheeze used a wide
      diversity of definitions of asthma/wheeze, comparison groups and methods to
      assess atopy. Among 30 risk factors evaluated in the 43 studies only 3 (family
      history of asthma/rhinitis/eczema, dampness/mold in the household, and lower
      respiratory tract infections in childhood) showed consistent associations with
      non-atopic asthma/wheeze. No or limited period of breastfeeding was less
      consistently associated with non-atopic asthma/wheeze. The few studies examining 
      the effects of overweight/obesity and psychological/social factors showed
      consistent associations. We used a novel graphical presentation of different risk
      factors for non-atopic asthma/wheeze, allowing a more complete perception of the 
      complex pattern of effects. CONCLUSIONS: More research using standardized
      methodology is needed on the causes of non-atopic asthma.

TI  - Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and risk of allergic sensitisation in
      children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 985-92
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2013-305444 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in children is linked with
      the development of allergic asthma. However, its influence on allergic
      sensitisation in children has not been conclusively determined. OBJECTIVE: To
      systematically review existing evidence of ETS exposure's impact on markers of
      allergic sensitisation in children. METHODS: CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE
      databases were searched. Included studies assessed following markers of atopic
      sensitisation: total immunoglobulin E (tIgE) concentrations, at least one
      specific IgE (sIgE+), and positive skin-prick tests (SPTs+) in ETS-exposed and
      non-exposed children. RESULTS: 8 studies on the influence of ETS on tIgE
      concentration (2603 patients), 6 studies on ETS and sIgE+ (9230 participants) and
      14 papers on ETS and SPT (14 150 patients) met our inclusion criteria. ETS was
      shown to raise tIgE concentrations by 27.7 IU/mL (95% CI 7.8 to 47.7; I(2)=58%;
      results based on 3 studies) and to increase the risk of atopic sensitisation, as 
      assessed by sIgE+ (OR=1.12, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.25; I(2)=54%; results based on 4
      studies) and SPT+ (OR=1.15; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.28; I(2)=0%; results based on 10
      studies). In a subgroup analysis, this effect was most pronounced in children <7 
      years (preschoolers) by OR=1.20; (95% CI 1.05 to 1.38) and OR=1.30 (95% CI 1.05
      to 1.61), (for sIgE+ and SPT+, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Current analysis
      supports an association between ETS exposure in early childhood and the increased
      risk of allergic sensitisation. Subgroup meta-analyses demonstrate that younger
      children suffer the most from detrimental immunomodulating effects of ETS
      exposure. This study underscores ETS as an important but avoidable risk factor
      for the development of allergic disease in children.

TI  - Association between low vitamin D levels and the diagnosis of asthma in children:
      a systematic review of cohort studies.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1186/1710-1492-10-31 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence about the association between low
      vitamin D levels in children and development of asthma in later life. The
      objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence for an
      epidemiological association between low serum levels of vitamin D and the
      diagnosis of asthma in children. METHODS: We used the Cochrane methodology for
      conducting systematic reviews. The search strategy included an electronic search 
      of MEDLINE and EMBASE in February 2013. Two reviewers completed, in duplicate and
      independently, study selection, data abstraction, and assessment of risk of bias.
      RESULTS: Of 1081 identified citations, three cohort studies met eligibility
      criteria. Two studies found that low serum vitamin D level is associated with an 
      increased risk of developing asthma late in childhood, while the third study
      found no association with either vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 levels. All three
      studies suffer from major methodological shortcomings that limit our confidence
      in their results. CONCLUSIONS: Available epidemiological evidence suggests a
      potential association between low serum levels of vitamin D and the diagnosis of 
      asthma in children. High quality studies are needed to reliably answer the
      question of interest.

      and meta-analysis.
PG  - 411-28
LID - 10.1111/nure.12121 [doi]
AB  - Major bibliographic databases were searched for studies examining the
      relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and the risk of wheezing and
      asthma. Random-effects models were used to pool study results. Subgroup analyses 
      were conducted by fruit and vegetable categories, study design, and age group.
      Twelve cohorts, 4 population-based case-control studies, and 26 cross-sectional
      studies published between January 1990 and July 2013 were identified. For the
      meta-analysis of adults and children, the relative risk (RR) and confidence
      intervals (CI) when comparing the highest intake group with the lowest intake
      group were 0.78 (95%CI, 0.70-0.87) for fruit and 0.86 (95%CI, 0.75-0.98) for
      vegetables. High intake of fruit and vegetables (RR = 0.76; 95%CI, 0.68-0.86 and 
      RR = 0.83; 95%CI, 0.72-0.96) reduced the risk of childhood wheezing. Total intake
      of fruit and vegetables had a negative association with risk of asthma in adults 
      and children (RR = 0.54; 95%CI, 0.41-0.69). Consuming fruit and vegetables during
      pregnancy had no association with the risk of asthma in offspring. High intake of
      fruit and vegetables may reduce the risk of asthma and wheezing in adults and
      children.

TI  - Family and carer smoking control programmes for reducing children's exposure to
      environmental tobacco smoke.
PG  - CD001746
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD001746.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children's exposure to other people's cigarette smoke (environmental 
      tobacco smoke, or ETS) is associated with a range of adverse health outcomes for 
      children. Parental smoking is a common source of children's exposure to ETS.
      Older children are also at risk of exposure to ETS in child care or educational
      settings. Preventing exposure to cigarette smoke in infancy and childhood has
      significant potential to improve children's health worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To
      determine the effectiveness of interventions aiming to reduce exposure of
      children to ETS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group
      Specialized Register and conducted additional searches of the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC,
      and The Social Science Citation Index & Science Citation Index (Web of
      Knowledge). Date of the most recent search: September 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Controlled trials with or without random allocation. Interventions must have
      addressed participants (parents and other family members, child care workers and 
      teachers) involved with the care and education of infants and young children
      (aged 0 to 12 years). All mechanisms for reduction of children's ETS exposure,
      and smoking prevention, cessation, and control programmes were included. These
      include health promotion, social-behavioural therapies, technology, education,
      and clinical interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors
      independently assessed studies and extracted data. Due to heterogeneity of
      methodologies and outcome measures, no summary measures were possible and results
      were synthesised narratively. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies met the inclusion
      criteria. Seven studies were judged to be at low risk of bias, 27 studies were
      judged to have unclear overall risk of bias and 23 studies were judged to have
      high risk of bias. Seven interventions were targeted at populations or community 
      settings, 23 studies were conducted in the 'well child' healthcare setting and 24
      in the 'ill child' healthcare setting. Two further studies conducted in
      paediatric clinics did not make clear whether the visits were to well or ill
      children, and another included both well and ill child visits. Thirty-six studies
      were from North America, 14 were in other high income countries and seven studies
      were from low- or middle-income countries. In only 14 of the 57 studies was there
      a statistically significant intervention effect for child ETS exposure reduction.
      Of these 14 studies, six used objective measures of children's ETS exposure.
      Eight of the studies had a high risk of bias, four had unclear risk of bias and
      two had a low risk of bias. The studies showing a significant effect used a range
      of interventions: seven used intensive counselling or motivational interviewing; 
      a further study used telephone counselling; one used a school-based strategy; one
      used picture books; two used educational home visits; one used brief intervention
      and one study did not describe the intervention. Of the 42 studies that did not
      show a significant reduction in child ETS exposure, 14 used more intensive
      counselling or motivational interviewing, nine used brief advice or counselling, 
      six used feedback of a biological measure of children's ETS exposure, one used
      feedback of maternal cotinine, two used telephone smoking cessation advice or
      support, eight used educational home visits, one used group sessions, one used an
      information kit and letter, one used a booklet and no smoking sign, and one used 
      a school-based policy and health promotion. In 32 of the 57 studies, there was
      reduction of ETS exposure for children in the study irrespective of assignment to
      intervention and comparison groups. One study did not aim to reduce children's
      tobacco smoke exposure, but rather aimed to reduce symptoms of asthma, and found 
      a significant reduction in symptoms in the group exposed to motivational
      interviewing. We found little evidence of difference in effectiveness of
      interventions between the well infant, child respiratory illness, and other child
      illness settings as contexts for parental smoking cessation interventions.
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While brief counselling interventions have been identified 
      as successful for adults when delivered by physicians, this cannot be
      extrapolated to adults as parents in child health settings. Although several
      interventions, including parental education and counselling programmes, have been
      used to try to reduce children's tobacco smoke exposure, their effectiveness has 
      not been clearly demonstrated. The review was unable to determine if any one
      intervention reduced parental smoking and child exposure more effectively than
      others, although seven studies were identified that reported motivational
      interviewing or intensive counselling provided in clinical settings was
      effective.

TI  - Maternal folate exposure in pregnancy and childhood asthma and allergy: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 55-64
AB  - Adequate folate status in early pregnancy is critical to prevent congenital
      malformations, yet little is known about whether exposure to folate, specifically
      folic acid supplementation beyond the recommended dose, influences chronic health
      outcomes. The link between maternal folate levels and risk of childhood asthma
      and allergic disease has been investigated in 10 large prospective cohort studies
      that reported conflicting results. While the majority of studies reported no
      association, those supporting a positive relationship found a small increase in
      risk that was generally transient in nature, confined to early childhood, and
      associated with folic acid supplementation in late pregnancy. This systematic
      review presents background information on maternal folate exposure and childhood 
      asthma, synthesizes the current epidemiologic evidence in the context of the
      methodological differences among studies and their potential limitations, and
      offers direction for future research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: this study aimed to review the literature regarding late preterm
      births (34 weeks to 36 weeks and 6 days of gestation) in its several aspects.
      SOURCES: the MEDLINE, LILACS, and Cochrane Library databases were searched, and
      the references of the articles retrieved were also used, with no limit of time.
      DATA SYNTHESIS: numerous studies showed a recent increase in late preterm births.
      In all series, late preterm comprised the majority of preterm births. Studies
      including millions of births showed a strong association between late preterm
      birth and neonatal mortality. A higher mortality in childhood and among young
      adults was also observed. Many studies found an association with several neonatal
      complications, and also with long-term disorders and sequelae: breastfeeding
      problems, cerebral palsy, asthma in childhood, poor school performance,
      schizophrenia, and young adult diabetes. Some authors propose strategies to
      reduce late preterm birth, or to improve neonatal outcome: use of antenatal
      corticosteroids, changes in some of the guidelines for early delivery in
      high-risk pregnancies, and changes in neonatal care for this group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      numerous studies show greater mortality and morbidity in late preterm infants
      compared with term infants, in addition to long-term disorders. More recent
      studies evaluated strategies to improve the outcomes of these neonates. Further
      studies on these strategies are needed.

TI  - Preterm birth and childhood wheezing disorders: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - e1001596
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001596 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence implicates early life factors in the aetiology 
      of non-communicable diseases, including asthma/wheezing disorders. We undertook a
      systematic review investigating risks of asthma/wheezing disorders in children
      born preterm, including the increasing numbers who, as a result of advances in
      neonatal care, now survive very preterm birth. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two
      reviewers independently searched seven online databases for contemporaneous (1
      January 1995-23 September 2013) epidemiological studies investigating the
      association between preterm birth and asthma/wheezing disorders. Additional
      studies were identified through reference and citation searches, and contacting
      international experts. Quality appraisal was undertaken using the Effective
      Public Health Practice Project instrument. We pooled unadjusted and adjusted
      effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis, investigated "dose-response"
      associations, and undertook subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses
      to assess the robustness of associations. We identified 42 eligible studies from 
      six continents. Twelve were excluded for population overlap, leaving 30 unique
      studies involving 1,543,639 children. Preterm birth was associated with an
      increased risk of wheezing disorders in unadjusted (13.7% versus 8.3%; odds ratio
      [OR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.57-1.87; 26 studies including 1,500,916 children) and
      adjusted analyses (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.29-1.65; 17 studies including 874,710
      children). The risk was particularly high among children born very preterm (<32
      wk gestation; unadjusted: OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.61-3.44; adjusted: OR 2.81, 95% CI
      2.55-3.12). Findings were most pronounced for studies with low risk of bias and
      were consistent across sensitivity analyses. The estimated
      population-attributable risk of preterm birth for childhood wheezing disorders
      was >/=3.1%. Key limitations related to the paucity of data from low- and
      middle-income countries, and risk of residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: There is 
      compelling evidence that preterm birth-particularly very preterm birth-increases 
      the risk of asthma. Given the projected global increases in children surviving
      preterm births, research now needs to focus on understanding underlying
      mechanisms, and then to translate these insights into the development of
      preventive interventions. REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42013004965.

TI  - Addition to inhaled corticosteroids of long-acting beta2-agonists versus
      anti-leukotrienes for chronic asthma.
PG  - CD003137
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003137.pub5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma patients who continue to experience symptoms despite taking
      regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent a management challenge.
      Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) and anti-leukotrienes (LTRA) are two treatment 
      options that could be considered as add-on therapy to ICS. OBJECTIVES: To compare
      the safety and efficacy of adding LABA versus LTRA to the treatment regimen for
      children and adults with asthma who remain symptomatic in spite of regular
      treatment with ICS. We specifically wished to examine the relative impact of the 
      two agents on asthma exacerbations, lung function, symptoms, quality of life,
      adverse health events and withdrawals. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane
      Airways Group Specialised Register until December 2012. We consulted reference
      lists of all included studies and contacted pharmaceutical manufacturers to ask
      about other published or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults or children with
      recurrent asthma that was treated with ICS along with a fixed dose of a LABA or
      an LTRA for a minimum of four weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review
      authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted
      data. We sought unpublished data and further details of study design when
      necessary. MAIN RESULTS: We included 18 RCTs (7208 participants), of which 16
      recruited adults and adolescents (6872) and two recruited children six to 17
      years of age (336) with asthma and significant reversibility to bronchodilator at
      baseline. Fourteen (79%) trials were of high methodological quality.The risk of
      exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (primary outcome of the review) 
      was significantly lower with the combination of LABA + ICS compared with LTRA +
      ICS-from 13% to 11% (eight studies, 5923 adults and 334 children; risk ratio (RR)
      0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.99; high-quality evidence). The
      number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with LABA
      compared with LTRA to prevent one additional exacerbation over four to 102 weeks 
      was 62 (95% CI 34 to 794). The choice of LTRA, the dose of ICS and the
      participants' age group did not significantly influence the magnitude of effect. 
      Although results were inconclusive, the effect appeared stronger in trials that
      used a single device rather than two devices to administer ICS and LABA and in
      trials of less than 12 weeks' duration.The addition of LABA to ICS was associated
      with a statistically greater improvement from baseline in lung function, as well 
      as in symptoms, rescue medication use and quality of life, although the latter
      effects were modest. LTRA was superior in the prevention of exercise-induced
      bronchospasm. More participants were satisfied with the combination of LABA + ICS
      than LTRA + ICS (three studies, 1625 adults; RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.20;
      moderate-quality evidence). The overall risk of withdrawal was significantly
      lower with LABA + ICS than with LTRA + ICS (13 studies, 6652 adults and 308
      children; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96; moderate-quality evidence). Although the 
      risk of overall adverse events was equivalent between the two groups, the risk of
      serious adverse events (SAE) approached statistical significance in disfavour of 
      LABA compared with LTRA (nine studies, 5658 adults and 630 children; RR 1.33, 95%
      CI 0.99 to 1.79; P value 0.06; moderate-quality evidence), with no apparent
      impact of participants' age group.The following adverse events were reported, but
      no significant differences were demonstrated between groups: headache (11
      studies, N = 6538); cardiovascular events (five studies, N = 5163), osteopenia
      and osteoporosis (two studies, N = 2963), adverse events (10 studies, N = 5977
      adults and 300 children). A significant difference in the risk of oral moniliasis
      was noted, but this represents a low occurrence rate. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In
      adults with asthma that is inadequately controlled by predominantly low-dose ICS 
      with significant bronchodilator reversibility, the addition of LABA to ICS is
      modestly superior to the addition of LTRA in reducing oral corticosteroid-treated
      exacerbations, with an absolute reduction of two percentage points. Differences
      favouring LABA over LTRA as adjunct therapy were observed in lung function and,
      to a lesser extend, in rescue medication use, symptoms and quality of life. The
      lower overall withdrawal rate and the higher proportion of participants satisfied
      with their therapy indirectly favour the combination of LABA + ICS over LTRA +
      ICS. Evidence showed a slightly increased risk of SAE with LABA compared with
      LTRA, with an absolute increase of one percentage point. Our findings modestly
      support the use of a single inhaler for the delivery of both LABA and low- or
      medium-dose ICS. Because of the paucity of paediatric trials, we are unable to
      draw firm conclusions about the best adjunct therapy in children.

TI  - The use of intravenous and inhaled magnesium sulphate in management of children
      with bronchial asthma.
PG  - 1809-15
LID - 10.3109/14767058.2013.876620 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and the
      leading cause of childhood morbidity. When uncontrolled, asthma can place
      significant limits on daily life, and is sometimes fatal. The use of magnesium
      sulphate (MgSO4) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute
      severe asthma in children. The efficacy of intravenous, or inhaled MgSO4 has been
      demonstrated, while little is known about the actual clinical use of either
      intravenous (IV) or inhaled MgSO4. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of
      intravenous (IV) and/or inhaled MgSO4 on hospital admissions and pulmonary
      function in children with asthma. This systematic review assessed the best
      available evidence for the use of either intravenous or inhaled MgSO4 in children
      with acute asthma. Magnesium deficiency is a common electrolyte disorder in
      children with acute severe asthma. Several authors reported that IV magnesium was
      effective in the treatment of moderate to acute asthma in children but evidence
      for nebulised magnesium was insufficient. In addition, it is used in severe,
      progressed cases to prevent respiratory failure and/or admission to the intensive
      care unit. It has bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects and modulates ion
      transport and influences intracellular calcium concentration. Intravenous MgSO4
      therapy helps in achieving earlier improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of 
      asthma, e.g. respiratory function and significantly reduced hospital admission,
      in children with acute severe asthma. The role of nebulised MgSO4 in asthmatic
      children requires further investigation. CONCLUSION: According to the previous
      studies, the author recommends the use of intravenous MgSO4 as a safe and
      effective adjunct to conventional bronchodilator therapy in acute severe asthma
      in children.

TI  - The efficacy of systemic therapy for internalizing and other disorders of
      childhood and adolescence: a systematic review of 38 randomized trials.
PG  - 619-52
LID - 10.1111/famp.12041 [doi]
AB  - Systemic therapy (ST) is one of the most widely applied psychotherapeutic
      approaches in the treatment of children and adolescents, yet few systematic
      reviews exist on the efficacy of ST with this age group. Parallel to a similar
      study on adults, a systematic review was performed to analyze the efficacy of ST 
      in the treatment of children and adolescents. All randomized or matched
      controlled trials (RCT) evaluating ST in any setting with child and adolescent
      index patients were identified by database searches and cross-references, as well
      as in existing meta-analyses and reviews. Inclusion criteria were: index patient 
      diagnosed with a DSM-IV or ICD-10 listed psychological disorder, or suffering
      from other clinically relevant conditions, and trial published by December 2011. 
      Studies were analyzed according to their sample, research methodology,
      interventions applied, and results at end-of-treatment and at follow-up. This
      article presents findings for internalizing and mixed disorders. Thirty-eight
      trials were identified, with 33 showing ST to be efficacious for the treatment of
      internalizing disorders (including mood disorders, eating disorders, and
      psychological factors in somatic illness). There is some evidence for ST being
      also efficacious in mixed disorders, anxiety disorders, Asperger disorder, and in
      cases of child neglect. Results were stable across follow-up periods of up to 5
      years. Trials on the efficacy of ST for externalizing disorders are presented in 
      a second article. There is a sound evidence base for the efficacy of ST as a
      treatment for internalizing disorders of child and adolescent patients.

LID - bmj.f6471 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of probiotic supplementation during
      pregnancy or infancy with childhood asthma and wheeze. DESIGN: Systematic review 
      and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase,
      and Central (Cochrane Library) databases from inception to August 2013, plus the 
      World Health Organization's international clinical trials registry platform and
      relevant conference proceedings for the preceding five years. Included trials and
      relevant reviews were forward searched in Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS: Two
      reviewers independently identified randomised controlled trials evaluating
      probiotics administered to mothers during pregnancy or to infants during the
      first year of life. The primary outcome was doctor diagnosed asthma; secondary
      outcomes included wheeze and lower respiratory tract infection. RESULTS: We
      identified 20 eligible trials including 4866 children. Trials were heterogeneous 
      in the type and duration of probiotic supplementation, and duration of follow-up.
      Only five trials conducted follow-up beyond participants' age of 6 years (median 
      24 months), and none were powered to detect asthma as the primary outcome. The
      overall rate of doctor diagnosed asthma was 10.7%; overall rates of incident
      wheeze and lower respiratory tract infection were 33.3% and 13.9%, respectively. 
      Among 3257 infants enrolled in nine trials contributing asthma data, the risk
      ratio of doctor diagnosed asthma in participants randomised to receive probiotics
      was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.21, I(2)=0%). The risk ratio of
      incident wheeze was 0.97 (0.87 to 1.09, I(2)=0%, 9 trials, 1949 infants). Among
      1364 infants enrolled in six trials, the risk ratio of lower respiratory tract
      infection after probiotic supplementation was 1.26 (0.99 to 1.61, I(2)=0%). We
      adjudicated most trials to be of high (ten trials) or unclear (nine trials) risk 
      of bias, mainly due to attrition. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support a 
      protective association between perinatal use of probiotics and doctor diagnosed
      asthma or childhood wheeze. Randomised controlled trials to date have not yielded
      sufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the primary prevention of these
      disorders. Extended follow-up of existing trials, along with further clinical and
      basic research, are needed to accurately define the role of probiotics in the
      prevention of childhood asthma. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

AB  - BACKGROUND: To provide a summary of the existing published knowledge on the
      association between sedentary lifestyle and childhood asthma. Twelve years ago,
      the first longitudinal studies carried out in children showed a relationship
      between physical activity and asthma. Several epidemiological studies confirmed
      these findings, with sedentary lifestyle predicting the onset of asthma. METHODS:
      A systematic review of epidemiological studies was conducted within the MEDLINE
      database. Epidemiological studies on children subjects, published in English were
      included in the review. A comprehensive literature search yielded 50 studies for 
      further consideration. Following the application of the eligibility criteria, we 
      identified 11 studies. RESULTS: A positive association and an excess risk of
      asthma during childhood were revealed to sedentary lifestyle. The findings proved
      the association between childhood asthma and sedentary lifestyle. The correlation
      between bronchial asthma and sedentary life during childhood and identifying
      whether preventable or treatable risk factors exist needs to be determined.
      Further research on the topic is essential for safer and standardised
      conclusions. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICE IMPLICATION: Asthma can be controlled when 
      managed properly. The role of the nurse as an educator should establish and
      maintain a relationship with patients in order to help them manage their disease.

TI  - Addition of anti-leukotriene agents to inhaled corticosteroids in children with
      persistent asthma.
PG  - CD009585
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009585.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the treatment of children with mild persistent asthma, low-dose
      inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended as the preferred monotherapy
      (referred to as step 2 of therapy). In children with inadequate asthma control on
      low doses of ICS (step 2), asthma management guidelines recommend adding an
      anti-leukotriene agent to existing ICS as one of three therapeutic options to
      intensify therapy (step 3). OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of the
      combination of anti-leukotriene agents and ICS to the use of the same, an
      increased, or a tapering dose of ICS in children and adolescents with persistent 
      asthma who remain symptomatic despite the use of maintenance ICS. In addition, we
      wished to determine the characteristics of people or treatments, if any, that
      influenced the magnitude of response attributable to the addition of
      anti-leukotrienes. SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways
      Group Specialised Register of Trials (CAGR), which were derived from systematic
      searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, and CINAHL; and the
      handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts, as well as the
      www.clinicaltrials.gov website. The search was conducted until January 2013.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials
      (RCTs) conducted in children and adolescents, aged one to 18 years, with asthma, 
      who remained symptomatic despite the use of a stable maintenance dose of ICS and 
      in whom anti-leukotrienes were added to the ICS if they were compared to the
      same, an increased, or a tapering dose of ICS for at least four weeks. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods expected by The Cochrane
      Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: Five paediatric (parallel group or cross-over)
      trials met the inclusion criteria. We considered two (40%) trials to be at a low 
      risk of bias. Four published trials, representing 559 children (aged >/= six
      years) and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma, contributed data to the
      review. No trial enrolled preschoolers. All trials used montelukast as the
      anti-leukotriene agent administered for between four and 16 weeks. Three trials
      evaluated the combination of anti-leukotrienes and ICS compared to the same dose 
      of ICS alone (step 3 versus step 2). No statistically significant group
      difference was observed in the only trial reporting participants with
      exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids over four weeks (N = 268
      participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.91).
      There was also no statistically significant difference in percentage change in
      FEV(1) (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) with mean difference (MD) 1.3 (95% 
      CI -0.09 to 2.69) in this trial, but a significant group difference was observed 
      in the morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR): N = 218
      participants; MD 9.70 L/min (95% CI 1.27 to 18.13) and MD 10.70 (95% CI 2.41 to
      18.99), respectively. One trial compared the combination of anti-leukotrienes and
      ICS to a higher-dose of ICS (step 3 versus step 3). No significant group
      difference was observed in this trial for participants with exacerbations
      requiring rescue oral corticosteroids over 16 weeks (N = 182 participants; RR
      0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25), nor was there any significant difference in
      exacerbations requiring hospitalisation. There was no statistically significant
      group difference in withdrawals overall or because of any cause with either
      protocol. No trial explored the impact of adding anti-leukotrienes as a means to 
      taper the dose of ICS. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The addition of anti-leukotrienes to
      ICS is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the need for 
      rescue oral corticosteroids or hospital admission compared to the same or an
      increased dose of ICS in children and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma.
      Although anti-leukotrienes have been licensed for use in children for over 10
      years, the paucity of paediatric trials, the absence of data on preschoolers, and
      the variability in the reporting of relevant clinical outcomes considerably limit
      firm conclusions. At present, there is no firm evidence to support the efficacy
      and safety of anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to ICS as a step-3 option in
      the therapeutic arsenal for children with uncontrolled asthma symptoms on
      low-dose ICS.

TI  - Does BCG vaccination protect against childhood asthma? Final results from the
      Manchester Community Asthma Study retrospective cohort study and updated
      systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Manchester Community Asthma Study (MANCAS) found a protective
      effect against the risk of wheeze at age 6 to 11 years for children given
      neonatal BCG vaccination. Our subsequent systematic review and meta-analysis
      suggested that BCG vaccination did not protect against allergic sensitization but
      might have exerted a protective effect against nonatopic asthma. OBJECTIVES: We
      sought to assess whether the protective effect of BCG vaccination on wheeze
      observed in the MANCAS cohort was maintained at age 13 to 17 years and to
      incorporate the findings from this final MANCAS analysis into an updated
      systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: BCG vaccination status was
      determined from health records and respiratory outcomes from questionnaire
      responses. We updated the systematic review and used fixed-effects and
      random-effects modeling to undertake meta-analyses. RESULTS: There were 1608
      participants in the final MANCAS analysis. The 12-month prevalence of wheeze was 
      15.1%. There was no difference in prevalence between those who were and were not 
      BCG vaccinated (15.8% vs 14.3%; relative risk, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.19). The
      updated meta-analysis incorporated 4 new studies: this showed that the protective
      effect of BCG vaccination against the development of asthma identified in our
      previous meta-analysis was attenuated (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00). No
      protective effect of BCG was seen for sensitization, eczema/atopic dermatitis,
      rhinoconjunctivitis, or allergy in general. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the
      final results of the MANCAS cohort and the updated systematic review and
      meta-analysis provide clearer evidence that any protective effect of BCG
      vaccination on childhood asthma is likely to be transient.

      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1272-81
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.113.065623 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma has become a critical public health problem because 
      of its high morbidity and increasing prevalence. The impact of nutrition and
      other exposures during pregnancy on long-term health and development of children 
      has been of increasing interest. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of the association of folate and folic acid intake during pregnancy
      and risk of asthma and other allergic outcomes in children. DESIGN: We performed 
      a systematic search of 8 electronic databases for articles that examined the
      association between prenatal folate or folic acid exposure and risk of asthma and
      other allergic outcomes (eg, allergy, eczema, and atopic dermatitis) in
      childhood. We performed a meta-analysis by using a random-effects model to derive
      a summary risk estimate of studies with similar exposure timing, exposure
      assessment, and outcomes. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis provided no evidence of an
      association between maternal folic acid supplement use (compared with no use) in 
      the prepregnancy period through the first trimester and asthma in childhood
      (summary risk estimate: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.30). Because of substantial
      heterogeneity in exposures and outcomes, it was not possible to generate summary 
      measures for other folate indicators (eg, blood folate concentrations) and asthma
      or allergy-related outcomes; however, the preponderance of primary risk estimates
      was not elevated. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support an association between
      periconceptional folic acid supplementation and increased risk of asthma in
      children. However, because of the limited number and types of studies in the
      literature, additional research is needed.

      review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.
PG  - 121
LID - 10.1186/1471-2431-13-121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma and obesity prevalence have increased in recent
      years suggesting a potential association. However, the direction of any
      association is poorly understood and the potential causal-relationship is
      unknown. METHODS: We examined the association between overweight/obesity, defined
      by body mass index (BMI) <18 years of age, and subsequent physician-diagnosed
      incident asthma at least one year after BMI assessment. We sought to explore
      potential effect modification by sex. PubMed and Embase were searched using
      keywords and restricted to subjects aged 0-18 years. There were no date or
      language restrictions. From each study we extracted: authors, publication date,
      location, overweight/obesity definitions, asthma definitions, number of
      participants, recruitment duration, description of cohort, follow-up time,
      adjusted effect estimates (with 95% CI) and estimates of subgroup analysis.
      RESULTS: Six prospective cohort studies which focused on children <18 years of
      age met criteria for inclusion. The combined risk ratio (RR) of overweight was
      associated with asthma (RR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.15, 1.58). In boys, the combined RR
      of overweight on asthma was significant (RR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.88). For
      girls, when BMI was defined by Z-score, the combined RR of overweight on asthma
      was also significant (RR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.06, 1.34). The combined risk ratio
      (RR) of obesity was associated with asthma in both boys and girls (RR = 1.50; 95%
      CI = 1.22, 1.83), in boys only (RR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.93) and in girls only
      (RR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.09, 2.14). CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and, especially, obese 
      children are at increased risk of subsequent physician diagnosed asthma in
      comparison to normal weight children. Except for sex, no studies reported any
      other potential effect modifiers. The observed sex effects were inconsistent.

TI  - Is there an association between microbial exposure and food allergy? A systematic
      review.
PG  - 311-320.e8
LID - 10.1111/pai.12064 [doi]
AB  - The environmental factors driving the recent increase in the prevalence of food
      allergy (FA) are unclear. Since associations have been demonstrated between
      microbial exposure and the likelihood of eczema and respiratory allergies, we
      reviewed the evidence for FA. Medline was systematically searched from inception 
      to the end of July 2012 for studies investigating links between FA and
      environmental exposures, likely to influence microbial exposure, such as
      Caesarean delivery, family size, day-care attendance, childhood infections,
      immunizations and antibiotic use. We selected studies reporting food challenge
      data, reported doctor-diagnosed (RDD) FA and food sensitization. Methodological
      differences and study heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. A total of 46
      studies were identified, of which 28 (60.9%) were prospective and 13 (28.3%) used
      food challenges to diagnose FA. Caesarean delivery was investigated in 13
      studies, of which three infant cohorts demonstrated an increase in
      challenge-proven FA (one cohort) and food sensitization (two cohorts), and one
      cross-sectional study reported increased RDDFA. Four studies investigated the
      effect of having siblings, with one infant cohort demonstrating less
      challenge-proven FA and a cross-sectional study showing a decrease in RDDFA.
      Attending childcare before 6 months was associated with less challenge-proven FA 
      in one cohort. A cross-sectional survey identified an inverse relationship
      between hepatitis A serology and peanut sensitization. One of eleven trials
      investigating probiotics demonstrated a quicker acquisition of milk tolerance
      amongst allergic infants. Factors influencing microbial exposure may be partly
      responsible for rising FA burden, but further prospective studies using
      double-blind placebo controlled food challenges as an outcome are required.

LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntt033 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Studies suggest an association between secondhand smoke exposure
      and the development of childhood asthma. Several countries are considering
      legislation to protect children from exposure. METHODS: A systematic review was
      conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Knowledge databases and a
      random effects meta-analysis was undertaken. Heterogeneity was assessed using the
      I (2) test. Publication and small study biases were examined visually using a
      funnel plot and tested formally using Egger test. Univariate and multivariate
      meta-regression analyses were undertaken, including a subgroup analysis of cohort
      studies to examine the effect of duration of follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty relevant 
      studies were identified (14 cross-sectional, 4 cohort, and 2 case-control) and
      provided 31 estimates of effect size. The pooled odds ratio was 1.32 (95% CI:
      1.23, 1.42, p < .001). There was moderate heterogeneity (I (2) = 74.2%, p <
      .001). On multivariate meta-regression analysis, effect size estimates were
      significantly higher for case-control studies (p = .042) and those using
      self-reported exposure to secondhand smoke (p = .050). There was no evidence of
      significant publication or small study bias (Egger test, p = .121). CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is now consistent evidence of a modest association between secondhand smoke
      and physician-diagnosed childhood asthma. These results lend support to continued
      efforts to reduce childhood exposure to secondhand smoke.

TI  - A systematic review of CD14 and toll-like receptors in relation to asthma in
      Caucasian children.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/1710-1492-9-10 [doi]
AB  - The aetiology of childhood asthma is complex. An early dysfunction in the
      immunological development of the innate immune system in combination with
      environmental factors possibly triggers asthma. CD14 and toll-like receptors are 
      important components of the innate immune system. The aim of this systematic
      review was to obtain a better insight into the relation between CD14 and
      toll-like receptors and childhood asthma in Caucasians. We searched PubMed and
      EMBASE for relevant articles. In total, 44 articles were included. The quality of
      the selected studies was independently assessed by the first two authors using
      the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Toll-like receptor 2, toll-like
      receptor 6, toll-like receptor 9, and toll-like receptor 10 appear to have some
      association with childhood asthma in Caucasians. The evidence for a relation of
      CD14 with childhood asthma is limited. In conclusion, there is no convincing
      evidence yet for a role of CD14 and toll-like receptors in relation to childhood 
      asthma. Future studies should include haplotype analysis and take environmental
      factors into account to further clarify the role of CD14 and toll-like receptors 
      on childhood asthma.

TI  - Intermittent versus daily inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma in
      children and adults.
PG  - CD009611
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended mainstay of
      treatment in children and adults with persistent asthma. However, often, ICS are 
      used intermittently by patients or recommended by physicians to be used only at
      the onset of exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to compare the
      efficacy and safety of intermittent versus daily ICS in the management of
      children and adults with persistent asthma and preschool-aged children suspected 
      of persistent asthma. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group
      Specialised Register of trials (CAGR) and the ClinicalTrials.gov web site up to
      October 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
      that compared intermittent ICS versus daily ICS in children and adults with
      persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers
      and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
      Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological
      quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the number of
      patients with one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the
      primary safety outcome was the number of patients with serious adverse health
      events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma
      control, adverse effects, withdrawal rates and inflammatory markers. Equivalence 
      was assumed if the risk ratio (RR) estimate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      were between 0.9 and 1.1. Quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN 
      RESULTS: Six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) met the 
      inclusion criteria for a total of seven group comparisons. The four paediatric
      trials (two involving preschool children and two school-aged children) and two
      adult parallel-group trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological 
      quality. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma
      contributed to the meta-analyses. There was no statistically significant group
      difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations
      requiring oral corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32; the 
      large confidence interval translates into a risk of exacerbations in the
      intermittent ICS group varying between 17% and 25%, assuming a 19% risk with
      daily ICS). Age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during
      exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary
      efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with
      serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03).
      Compared to the daily ICS group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller
      improvement in change from baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56%
      (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%), fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference 
      (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14%
      to -4%), more use of rescue beta2-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23)
      and a greater increase from baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per
      billion (95% CI 11.95 to 21.64). There was no significant group difference in
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life, airway
      hyper-reactivity, adverse effects, hospitalisations, emergency department visits 
      or withdrawals. In paediatric trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and
      beclomethasone) were associated with greater growth by 0.41 cm change from
      baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69) compared to daily treatment.
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In children and adults with persistent asthma and in
      preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, there was low quality evidence
      that intermittent and daily ICS strategies were similarly effective in the use of
      rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events. The
      strength of the evidence means that we cannot currently assume equivalence
      between the two options.. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several
      indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever
      use. Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was
      associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and
      beclomethasone. Clinicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm
      of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one year) 
      impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.

TI  - Nurse versus physician-led care for the management of asthma.
PG  - CD009296
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009296.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood and prevalence
      is also high in adulthood, thereby placing a considerable burden on healthcare
      resources. Therefore, effective asthma management is important to reduce
      morbidity and to optimise utilisation of healthcare facilities. OBJECTIVES: To
      review the effectiveness of nurse-led asthma care provided by a specialised
      asthma nurse, a nurse practitioner, a physician assistant or an otherwise
      specifically trained nursing professional, working relatively independently from 
      a physician, compared to traditional care provided by a physician. Our scope
      included all outpatient care for asthma, both in primary care and in hospital
      settings. SEARCH METHODS: We carried out a comprehensive search of databases
      including The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify trials up to
      August 2012. Bibliographies of relevant papers were searched, and handsearching
      of relevant publications was undertaken to identify additional trials. SELECTION 
      CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing nurse-led care versus
      physician-led care in asthma for the same aspect of asthma care. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane
      Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies on 588 adults and children were
      included concerning nurse-led care versus physician-led care. One study included 
      154 patients with uncontrolled asthma, while the other four studies including 434
      patients with controlled or partly controlled asthma. The studies were of good
      methodological quality (although it is not possible to blind people giving or
      receiving the intervention to which group they are in). There was no
      statistically significant difference in the number of asthma exacerbations and
      asthma severity after treatment (duration of follow-up from six months to two
      years). Only one study had healthcare costs as an outcome parameter, no
      statistical differences were found. Although not a primary outcome, quality of
      life is a patient-important outcome and in the three trials on 380 subjects that 
      reported on this outcome, there was no statistically significant difference
      (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 
      0.17). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant difference between nurse-led
      care for patients with asthma compared to physician-led care for the outcomes
      assessed. Based on the relatively small number of studies in this review,
      nurse-led care may be appropriate in patients with well-controlled asthma. More
      studies in varied settings and among people with varying levels of asthma control
      are needed with data on adverse events and health-care costs.

TI  - Exhaled breath condensate in pediatric asthma: promising new advance or pouring
      cold water on a lot of hot air? a systematic review.
PG  - 419-42
LID - 10.1002/ppul.22776 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) analysis is a simple non-invasive
      technique that allows repeated collection of breath samples with a minimum of
      inconvenience for the subject. These breath samples can potentially indicate lung
      disease activity and given the ease of collection, EBC is becoming a useful
      research tool in the study of respiratory diseases. It has the potential to be
      used in both population-based studies and in the context of pediatric asthma it
      may prove useful in diagnosis and monitoring. METHODS: A systematic review was
      conducted to identify studies of EBC markers in childhood asthma. RESULTS: Most
      of the studies were cross-sectional in design, and the results suggest that
      simple chemical entities such as hydrogen ions (as pH), hydrogen peroxide, and
      oxides of nitrogen are associated with pediatric allergic asthma and
      exacerbations. In addition, more complex molecules including leukotrienes,
      prostaglandins, and cytokines such as the interleukins IL-4 and IL-5 are also
      elevated in the breath of those with asthma. CONCLUSION: EBC has the potential to
      aid diagnosis, and to evaluate the inflammatory status of asthmatic children.
      Future studies may be able to refine further how best to collect EBC samples, to 
      interpret them, and the technique has the potential to allow repeated sampling
      which will allow studies of natural history, pathogenesis and response to
      treatment to be undertaken.

TI  - Breastfeeding: an overview of oral and general health benefits.
PG  - 143-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is the reference against which alternative infant
      feeding models must be measured with regard to growth, development and other
      health outcomes. Although not a systematic review, this report provides an update
      for dental professionals, including an overview of general and oral
      health-related benefits associated with breastfeeding. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED:
      The authors examined the literature regarding general health protections that
      breastfeeding confers to infants and mothers and explored associations between
      breastfeeding, occlusion in the primary dentition and early childhood caries. To 
      accomplish these goals, they reviewed systematic reviews when available and
      supplemented them with comparative studies and with statements and reports from
      major nongovernmental and governmental organizations. RESULTS: When compared with
      health outcomes among formula-fed children, the health advantages associated with
      breastfeeding include a lower risk of acute otitis media, gastroenteritis and
      diarrhea, severe lower respiratory infections, asthma, sudden infant death
      syndrome, obesity and other childhood diseases and conditions. Evidence also
      suggests that breastfed children may develop a more favorable occlusion in the
      primary dentition. The results of a systematic review in which researchers
      examined the relationship between breastfeeding and early childhood caries were
      inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The American Academy of
      Pediatric Dentistry, Chicago, suggests that parents gently clean infants' gums
      and teeth after breastfeeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics, Elk Grove
      Village, Ill., recommends that breastfeeding should be exclusive for about the
      first six months of life and should continue, with the introduction of
      appropriate complementary foods, to at least age 12 months or beyond, as desired 
      by mother and child. Dentists and staff members can take steps to ensure they are
      familiar with the evidence and guidelines pertaining to breastfeeding and to oral
      health. They are encouraged to follow the surgeon general's recommendations to
      promote and support optimal breastfeeding and oral health practices among their
      patients.

      pediatric conditions: a systematic review.
PG  - 2183-200
LID - 10.1007/s11136-012-0343-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Childhood illness or disability can affect the quality of life (QoL) of 
      the child's primary caregiver. Our aim was to identify, describe the content and 
      systematically review the psychometric properties of condition-specific QoL
      questionnaires for caregivers of children. METHODS: Medline, PsycInfo, Embase,
      CINAHL, and the Cochrane library databases were searched from 1 January 1990 to
      30 June 2011. Articles related to the development and measurement of caregiver
      QoL were screened to identify condition-specific questionnaires. The
      characteristics of the questionnaires were extracted, and their psychometric
      properties were evaluated using the consensus-based standards for the selection
      of health measurement instruments checklist with 4-point scale. RESULTS: We
      identified 25 condition-specific caregiver QoL questionnaires covering 16
      conditions. Conditions included atopic dermatitis, asthma, diabetes, oro-facial
      disorders, and two acute illnesses. Questionnaires were developed predominantly
      in high-income countries. Questionnaires had the highest quality rating for
      content validity, followed by hypothesis testing. Methodological quality was
      satisfactory for criterion validity; fair in reliability and responsiveness; and 
      poor in internal consistency and structural validity. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing
      number of questionnaires developed over time shows improved recognition of the
      importance of caregiver QoL. There is a paucity of QoL questionnaires for
      caregivers of otherwise healthy children suffering from physical injuries and
      acute conditions associated with significant caregiver burden. Cultural
      validation of existing and new questionnaires in lower-income countries is
      necessary. Data collected by condition-specific questionnaires can assist
      clinicians and health economists in estimating caregiver burden and the types of 
      healthcare services caregivers require and may be useful for healthcare
      administrators to evaluate interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disruption of developing immune and respiratory systems by early-life
      exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) could result into reduced
      capacity to fight infections and increased risk to develop allergic
      manifestations later in life. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the
      epidemiologic literature on the adverse effects of early-life exposure to POPs on
      respiratory health, allergy and the immune system in infancy, childhood and
      adolescence. METHODS: Based on published guidelines for systematic reviews, two
      independent researchers searched for published articles in MEDLINE and SCOPUS
      using defined keywords on POPs and respiratory health, immune function and
      allergy. Study eligibility criteria were defined to select the articles. RESULTS:
      This review of 41 studies finds limited evidence for prenatal exposure to DDE,
      PCBs and dioxins and risk of respiratory infections. Evidence was limited also
      for postnatal exposure to PCBs, specifically ndl-PCBs, and reduced immune
      response after vaccination in childhood. The review indicates lack of association
      between postnatal exposure to PCBs/ndl-PCBs and risk of asthma-related symptoms. 
      For the other exposure-outcome associations reviewed evidence was inadequate.
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Current epidemiological evidence suggests that
      early-life exposure to POPs can adversely influence immune and respiratory
      systems development. Heterogeneity between studies in exposure and outcome
      assessment and the small number of studies for any given exposure-outcome
      relationship currently make comparisons difficult and meta-analyses impossible.
      Also, mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Recommendations for significantly
      improving our understanding thus include harmonization of exposure and outcome
      assessment between studies, conduct of larger studies, long-term assessment of
      respiratory infections and asthma symptoms in order to identify critical periods 
      of susceptibility, integration of the potential immunotoxic mechanisms of POPs,
      and use of new statistical tools to detangle the role of multiple exposures on
      multiple outcomes.

AB  - Severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infancy is associated with 
      substantial morbidity worldwide; whether it is a risk factor for childhood asthma
      is contentious. A systematic review of 28 articles was conducted, summarizing
      estimates of asthma risk after RSV hospitalization during infancy. Prevalence
      estimates of asthma, among those hospitalized for RSV in infancy, were from 8% to
      63%, 10% to 92%, and 37%, at ages <5, 5 to 11, and >/= 12 years, respectively.
      These rates were higher than those among non-hospitalized comparisons. The
      attributable risk of asthma due to RSV ranged from 13% to 22% and from 11% to 27%
      among children aged </= 5 and aged 5 to 11, respectively, and was 32% among
      children >/= 12 years of age. Overall, 59% of asthma prevalence estimates from
      those previously hospitalized for RSV exceeded 20%, compared to only 6% of
      non-hospitalized comparison estimates. Despite variability in asthma prevalence
      estimates after RSV-related hospitalization, available data suggest a link
      between severe RSV infection in infancy and childhood asthma.

AB  - For asthma and psychological morbidity, it is well established that higher
      prevalence among males in childhood is replaced by higher prevalence among
      females by adolescence. This review investigates whether there is evidence for a 
      similar emerging female 'excess' in relation to a broad range of physical
      morbidity measures. Establishing whether this pattern is generalised or health
      outcome-specific will further understandings of the aetiology of gender
      differences in health. Databases (Medline; Embase; CINAHL; PsycINFO; ERIC) were
      searched for English language studies (published 1992-2010) presenting physical
      morbidity prevalence data for males and females, for at least two age-bands
      within the age-range 4-17 years. A three-stage screening process (initial
      sifting; detailed inspection; extraction of full papers), was followed by study
      quality appraisals. Of 11 245 identified studies, 41 met the inclusion criteria. 
      Most (n = 31) presented self-report survey data (five longitudinal, 26
      cross-sectional); 10 presented routinely collected data (GP/hospital statistics).
      Extracted data, supplemented by additional data obtained from authors of the
      included studies, were used to calculate odds ratios of a female excess, or
      female:male incident rate ratios as appropriate. To test whether these changed
      with age, the values were logged and regressed on age in random effects
      meta-regressions. These showed strongest evidence of an emerging/increasing
      female excess for self-reported measures of headache, abdominal pain, tiredness, 
      migraine and self-assessed health. Type 1 diabetes and epilepsy, based on
      routinely collected data, did not show a significant emerging/increasing female
      excess. For most physical morbidity measures reviewed, the evidence broadly
      points towards an emerging/increasing female excess during the transition to
      adolescence, although results varied by morbidity measure and study design, and
      suggest that this may occur at a younger age than previously thought.

AB  - Asthma and overweight/obesity prevalence are both increasing worldwide.
      Overweight/obesity has been suggested as a risk factor for developing asthma. The
      aim of this review is to present and evaluate recent publications that help
      answer the question: "Is increased body weight (at least overweight status)
      related to asthma in children?" A systematic review of epidemiologic literature
      was carried out using the MEDLINE database. Epidemiologic studies on young human 
      subjects (ie, infants, children, and adolescents), published in English during
      the period 2006-2011 were included. A comprehensive literature search yielded 434
      studies for further consideration. Forty-eight studies fulfilled the review's
      eligibility criteria. Two researchers applied the MOOSE Guidelines for
      Meta-Analysis and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies on all identified
      studies. Current evidence supports a weak yet significant association between
      high body weight and asthma. New information indicates that central obesity in
      children increases asthma risk. Also, the link between high body weight and
      asthma may be stronger in nonallergic asthma. There are mixed results about the
      importance of sex. Although the nature of the association between
      overweight/obese status and asthma remains unclear, prospective studies point
      that high body weight precedes asthma symptoms. These data add weight to the
      importance of preventing and treating a high body weight against asthma outcomes.
      Available research in children has not studied adequately the influence of weight
      change (either gain or loss) on asthma symptoms, an area of clinical importance. 
      Beyond energy control, the role of diet as a possible inflammatory stimulus
      warrants further investigation. Limited data seem to favor the promotion of
      breastfeeding in attenuating the overweight/obesity-asthma relationship. Finally,
      future research should include weight intervention studies assessing various
      measures of body fat in relation to well-defined asthma outcomes.

TI  - Intermittent versus daily inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma in
      children and adults.
PG  - CD009611
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended mainstay of
      treatment in children and adults with persistent asthma. Yet often, ICS are used 
      intermittently by patients or recommended by physicians to be used only at the
      onset of exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to compare the
      efficacy and safety of intermittent versus daily ICS in the management of
      children and adults with persistent asthma and preschool-aged children suspected 
      of persistent asthma. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group
      Specialised Register of trials (CAGR) and the ClinicalTrials.gov website up to
      December 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials
      (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus daily ICS in children and adults
      with persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue
      relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion,
      methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the
      number of patients with one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids 
      and the primary safety outcome was the number of patients with serious adverse
      health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests,
      asthma control, adverse effects, withdrawal rates and inflammatory markers.
      Equivalence was assumed if the risk ratio (RR) estimate and its 95% confidence
      interval (CI) were between 0.9 and 1.1. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials (including one
      trial testing two relevant protocols) met the inclusion criteria for a total of
      seven group comparisons. The four paediatric trials (two involving preschool
      children and two school-aged children) and two adult parallel-group trials,
      lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality. A total of 1211
      patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma contributed to the
      meta-analyses. There was no statistically significant group difference in the
      risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral
      corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32). The patients' age,
      severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and
      trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No
      group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health
      events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03). Compared to the daily ICS
      group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller improvement in change from 
      baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56% (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%),
      fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28
      to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14% to -4%), more use of rescue
      beta(2)-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23) and a greater increase from
      baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per billion (95% CI 11.95 to
      21.64). There was no significant group difference in forced expiratory volume in 
      one second (FEV(1)), quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse effects,
      hospitalisations, emergency department visits or withdrawals. In paediatric
      trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and beclomethasone) were associated with
      greater growth by 0.41 cm change from baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to
      0.69) compared to daily treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In children and adults
      with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, 
      intermittent and daily ICS strategies did not significantly differ in the use of 
      rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events, neither
      did they reach equivalence. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several
      indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever
      use. Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was
      associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and
      beclomethasone. The clinician should carefully weigh the potential benefits and
      harm of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one
      year) impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.

TI  - Gender difference of childhood overweight and obesity in predicting the risk of
      incident asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 222-31
LID - 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2012.01055.x [doi]
AB  - The aims of our meta-analysis were (i) to quantify the predictability of
      childhood overweight and obesity on the risk of incident asthma; and (ii) to
      evaluate the gender difference on this relationship. The selection criteria
      included prospective cohort paediatric studies which use age- and sex-specific
      body mass index (BMI) as a measure of childhood overweight and the primary
      outcome of incident asthma. A total of 1,027 studies were initially identified
      through online database searches, and finally 6 studies met the inclusion
      criteria. The combined result of reported relative risk from the 6 included
      studies revealed that overweight children conferred increased risks of incident
      asthma as compared with non-overweight children (relative risk, 1.19; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.37). The relationship was further elevated for
      obesity vs. non-obesity (relative risk, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.16-3.50). A
      dose-responsiveness of elevated BMI on asthma incidence was observed (P for
      trend, 0.004). Obese boys had a significantly larger effect than obese girls
      (relative risk, boys: 2.47; 95% CI, 1.57-3.87; girls: 1.25; 95% CI, 0.51-3.03),
      with significant dose-dependent effect. Proposed mechanisms of gender difference 
      could be through pulmonary mechanics, sleep disordered breathing and leptin.
      Further research might be needed to better understand the exact mechanism of
      gender difference on the obesity-asthma relationship.

TI  - The prevalence of childhood asthma in China: a systematic review.
PG  - 860
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-12-860 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that the prevalence of asthma has been reported to
      increase in many places around the world during the last decades. Therefore, the 
      aim of this study was to identify and review studies of asthma prevalence among
      children in China and address time trends and regional variation in asthma.
      METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and China
      National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Selected articles had to
      describe an original study that showed the prevalence of asthma among children
      aged 0-14 years. RESULTS: A total of 74 articles met the inclusion criteria. The 
      lifetime prevalence of asthma varied between 1.1% in Lhasa (Tibet) and 11.0% in
      Hong Kong in studies following the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in
      Childhood (ISAAC) protocol. The prevalence was 3% or lower in most articles
      following Chinese diagnostic criteria. One article reported the results from two 
      national surveys and showed that the current average prevalence of asthma for the
      total study population had increased from 1990 to 2000 (0.9% to 1.5%). The lowest
      current prevalence was found in Lhasa (0.1% in 1990, 0.5% in 2000). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The prevalence of childhood asthma was generally low, both in studies following
      the ISAAC and Chinese diagnostic criteria. Assessment of time trends and regional
      variations in asthma prevalence was difficult due to insufficient data, variation
      in diagnostic criteria, difference in data collection methods, and uncertainty in
      prevalence measures. However, the findings from one large study of children from 
      27 different cities support an increase in current prevalence of childhood asthma
      from 1990 to 2000. The lowest current prevalence of childhood asthma was found in
      Tibet.

TI  - Laser acupuncture for the treatment of asthma in children: a systematic review of
      randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 773-7
LID - 10.3109/02770903.2012.691194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Laser acupuncture has often been recommended as a
      treatment of asthma. The technique is noninvasive, and seems particularly
      suitable for children. However, the results from several clinical trials are
      contradictory. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of
      laser acupuncture in the treatment of childhood asthma. METHODS: Literature
      searches of electronic database were conducted in The Cochrane Library, Medline, 
      EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, and two Chinese literature databases (CNKI and VIP) up to
      February 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing laser acupuncture for 
      asthma in children were included. No language restrictions were applied. Three
      authors independently selected articles, extracted data, and assessed trial
      quality. RESULTS: Our searches identified 13 potential eligible studies, of which
      three with a total number of 176 patients met our inclusion criteria. The quality
      of included RCTs were low. One RCT with a parallel group design showed positive
      results, while two crossover RCTs generated negative results. There was variation
      in the type of patients, the interventions, and outcome measures. Because of the 
      significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was
      performed. CONCLUSIONS: The number of RCTs and their total sample sizes are
      small; and their methodological quality is low. Therefore, no compelling evidence
      exists to suggest that laser acupuncture is not an effective treatment for
      childhood asthma. Further rigorous studies are warranted.

PG  - 509-18
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-3038.2012.01312.x [doi]
AB  - Asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder that has become substantially more
      common over the past decades. One environmental factor for which particularly
      strong associations with asthma and allergic diseases have been described is
      exposure to farming environments in childhood. The aim of this systematic review 
      was to update and extend existing narrative reviews, test for heterogeneity of
      effect across studies, and conduct a meta-analysis to report a summary effect
      measure. Published relevant literature was searched through PubMed including all 
      articles added to PubMed before September 1, 2011. Articles were included if they
      reported an epidemiological study on the exposure to a farming environment in
      childhood and subsequent wheeze or asthma. Heterogeneity of effect measures
      across studies was evaluated using Cochran's Q and I(2). Random-effects
      meta-analysis was performed to summarize effect measures for various outcome
      definitions. In total, 357 retrieved abstracts revealed 52 original articles from
      39 studies with data considered for the meta-analysis. Most studies were
      conducted among children or on childhood onset of disease. Most data were
      published on doctor-diagnosed asthma or current wheeze. The meta-analysis showed 
      substantial heterogeneity across studies with similar outcome definitions.
      Nonetheless, the combined effects were statistically significant and showed an
      approximate 25% lower asthma prevalence among exposed subjects compared with
      unexposed subjects. The protective 'farm-effect' on asthma was reported in
      numerous studies. Its underlying factors ought to be studied, and promising
      efforts have been already made. However, the heterogeneity of the effect across
      studies should also be investigated because whatever causes it is a potential
      threat to valid synthesis of evidence and to the detection of specific protective
      factors.

TI  - Anti-leukotriene agents compared to inhaled corticosteroids in the management of 
      recurrent and/or chronic asthma in adults and children.
PG  - CD002314
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD002314.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-leukotrienes (5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and leukotriene
      receptors antagonists) serve as alternative monotherapy to inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS) in the management of recurrent and/or chronic asthma in
      adults and children. OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and efficacy of
      anti-leukotrienes compared to inhaled corticosteroids as monotherapy in adults
      and children with asthma and to provide better insight into the influence of
      patient and treatment characteristics on the magnitude of effects. SEARCH
      METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2010), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2010),
      CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2010), the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, and the
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Dec 2010), abstract books, and
      reference lists of review articles and trials. We contacted colleagues and the
      international headquarters of anti-leukotrienes producers. SELECTION CRITERIA: We
      included randomised trials that compared anti-leukotrienes with inhaled
      corticosteroids as monotherapy for a minimum period of four weeks in patients
      with asthma aged two years and older. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review
      authors independently assessed the methodological quality of trials and extracted
      data. The primary outcome was the number of patients with at least one
      exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included
      patients with at least one exacerbation requiring hospital admission, lung
      function tests, indices of chronic asthma control, adverse effects, withdrawal
      rates and biological inflammatory markers. MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-five trials met
      the inclusion criteria for this review. Fifty-six trials (19 paediatric trials)
      contributed data (representing total of 10,005 adults and 3,333 children); 21
      trials were of high methodological quality; 44 were published in full-text. All
      trials pertained to patients with mild or moderate persistent asthma. Trial
      durations varied from four to 52 weeks. The median dose of inhaled
      corticosteroids was quite homogeneous at 200 microg/day of microfine
      hydrofluoroalkane-propelled beclomethasone or equivalent (HFA-BDP eq). Patients
      treated with anti-leukotrienes were more likely to suffer an exacerbation
      requiring systemic corticosteroids (N = 6077 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.51, 
      95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17, 1.96). For every 28 (95% CI 15 to 82) patients
      treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids, there was one 
      additional patient with an exacerbation requiring rescue systemic
      corticosteroids. The magnitude of effect was significantly greater in patients
      with moderate compared with those with mild airway obstruction (RR 2.03, 95% CI
      1.41, 2.91 versus RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97, 1.61), but was not significantly
      influenced by age group (children representing 23% of the weight versus adults), 
      anti-leukotriene used, duration of intervention, methodological quality, and
      funding source. Significant group differences favouring inhaled corticosteroids
      were noted in most secondary outcomes including patients with at least one
      exacerbation requiring hospital admission (N = 2715 participants; RR 3.33; 95% CI
      1.02 to 10.94), the change from baseline FEV(1) (N = 7128 participants; mean
      group difference (MD) 110 mL, 95% CI 140 to 80) as well as other lung function
      parameters, asthma symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication use,
      symptom-free days, the quality of life, parents' and physicians' satisfaction.
      Anti-leukotriene therapy was associated with increased risk of withdrawals due to
      poor asthma control (N = 7669 participants; RR 2.56; 95% CI 2.01 to 3.27). For
      every thirty one (95% CI 22 to 47) patients treated with anti-leukotrienes
      instead of inhaled corticosteroids, there was one additional withdrawal due to
      poor control. Risk of side effects was not significantly different between both
      groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: As monotherapy, inhaled corticosteroids display
      superior efficacy to anti-leukotrienes in adults and children with persistent
      asthma; the superiority is particularly marked in patients with moderate airway
      obstruction. On the basis of efficacy, the results support the current
      guidelines' recommendation that inhaled corticosteroids remain the preferred
      monotherapy.

TI  - Prevalence of asthma in elementary school age children in Iran--a systematic
      review and meta analysis study.
PG  - 887-93
AB  - Asthma is a common chronic disease of childhood which causes considerable
      morbidity. Asthma affects 1 in 13 school-age children and is a leading cause of
      office and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and school absenteeism.
      Estimating the prevalence of asthma in the community is important in assessing
      the impact of asthma at the level of population. Since the pooled prevalence of
      asthma in Iranian elementary school age children (6-12 years old) was not
      identified, we decide to conduct a meta-analysis study to estimate the prevalence
      of asthma in elementary school age children in Iran. In order to gather the data,
      we searched a number of international electronic sources such as Pub Med, Embase,
      science direct, and ISI for English articles, and Iranian National Knowledge
      Infrastructure (scientific information) sources such as Iranmedx, Iran-doc, and
      SID for Persian articles from February 1995 to January 2010 to access the data.
      We used the words childhood, asthma, prevalence, and Iranian for searching
      relevant papers and used a data extraction form for the extracted data. The
      outcome in this Meta analysis study was response to the question, "Ever had
      asthma", based on the ISSAC program questionnaire. Eleven relevant articles were 
      included for the Meta analysis. The pooled prevalence for girls, boys, and the
      two genders was obtained as 3.2% (CI; 2.5 to 3.9%), 4.3% (CI; 3.5 to 5.1%) and
      3.9% (CI; 3.2 to 4.7%), respectively. The pooled prevalence of asthma in Iranian 
      elementary school age children is low in comparison to the other reports.

TI  - Low income/socio-economic status in early childhood and physical health in later 
      childhood/adolescence: a systematic review.
PG  - 424-31
LID - 10.1007/s10995-012-1010-2 [doi]
AB  - To systematically review the literature on the relationship between early
      childhood low income/socioeconomic status (SES) and physical health in later
      childhood/adolescence, to identify gaps in the literature and to suggest new
      avenues for research. A systematic search of electronic databases from their
      start date to November 2011 was conducted to identify prospective longitudinal
      studies in industrialized countries with a measure of low income/SES in the first
      5 years of life and physical health outcomes in later childhood or adolescence.
      STROBE criteria were used to assess study quality. Risk estimates were expressed 
      as odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals where possible. Heterogeneity of
      studies precluded meta-analysis. Nine studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
      Significant associations of early childhood low income/SES with activity-limiting
      illness, parent-reported poor health status, acute and recurrent infections,
      increasing BMI percentile and hospitalization were reported. Results for
      parent-reported asthma were less consistent: there was a significant association 
      with low income/SES in early childhood in 2 studies but null findings in 3
      others. This systematic review of the association of early childhood low
      income/SES with physical health status in later childhood and adolescence shows
      that, in contrast to the extensive literature on the impact of poor childhood
      social circumstances on adult health, the evidence base is limited. The
      literature points to some associations of early low income/SES with later poor
      health status, but many key research questions remain unanswered. Implications
      for further research are considered.

TI  - Prenatal and passive smoke exposure and incidence of asthma and wheeze:
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 735-44
LID - 10.1542/peds.2011-2196 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Exposure to passive smoke is a common and avoidable risk factor for
      wheeze and asthma in children. Substantial growth in the prospective cohort study
      evidence base provides an opportunity to generate new and more detailed estimates
      of the magnitude of the effect. A systematic review and meta-analysis was
      conducted to provide estimates of the prospective effect of smoking by parents or
      household members on the risk of wheeze and asthma at different stages of
      childhood. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and conference
      abstracts to identify cohort studies of the incidence of asthma or wheeze in
      relation to exposure to prenatal or postnatal maternal, paternal, or household
      smoking in subjects aged up to 18 years old. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by using random effects model. RESULTS:
      We identified 79 prospective studies. Exposure to pre- or postnatal passive smoke
      exposure was associated with a 30% to 70% increased risk of incident wheezing
      (strongest effect from postnatal maternal smoking on wheeze in children aged </=2
      years, OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.24-2.35, 4 studies) and a 21% to 85% increase in
      incident asthma (strongest effect from prenatal maternal smoking on asthma in
      children aged </=2 years, OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.35-2.53, 5 studies). CONCLUSIONS:
      Building upon previous findings, exposure to passive smoking increases the
      incidence of wheeze and asthma in children and young people by at least 20%.
      Preventing parental smoking is crucially important to the prevention of asthma.

TI  - Long term sequelae from childhood pneumonia; systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e31239
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0031239 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risks of long term sequelae from childhood pneumonia have not
      been systematically assessed. The aims of this study were to: (i) estimate the
      risks of respiratory sequelae after pneumonia in children under five years; (ii) 
      estimate the distribution of the different types of respiratory sequelae; and
      (iii) compare sequelae risk by hospitalisation status and pathogen. METHODS: We
      systematically reviewed published papers from 1970 to 2011. Standard global
      burden of disease categories (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease,
      bronchiectasis) were labelled as major sequelae. 'Minor' sequelae (chronic
      bronchitis, asthma, other abnormal pulmonary function, other respiratory
      disease), and multiple impairments were also included. Thirteen papers were
      selected for inclusion. Synthesis was by random effects meta-analysis and
      meta-regression. RESULTS: Risk of at least one major sequelae was 5.5% (95%
      confidence interval [95% CI] 2.8-8.3%) in non hospitalised children and 13.6%
      [6.2-21.1%]) in hospitalised children. Adenovirus pneumonia was associated with
      the highest sequelae risk (54.8% [39.2-70.5%]) but children hospitalised with no 
      pathogen isolated also had high risk (17.6% [10.9-24.3%]). The most common type
      of major sequela was restrictive lung disease (5.4% [2.5-10.2%]) . Potential
      confounders such as loss to follow up and median age at infection were not
      associated with sequelae risk in the final models. CONCLUSIONS: All children with
      pneumonia diagnosed by a health professional should be considered at risk of long
      term sequelae. Evaluation of childhood pneumonia interventions should include
      potential impact on long term respiratory sequelae.

AB  - Cow's milk is a common cause of food allergy in children. Children usually
      outgrow cow's milk allergy by the age of 3-5 years, but some will have persistent
      symptoms beyond childhood. We performed a systematic review of randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to assess the evidence
      supporting the use of oral immunotherapy in IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy to
      inform the World Allergy Organization guidelines. Of 1034 screened articles
      published until May 2011, five RCTs and five observational studies fulfilled a
      priori specified inclusion criteria. RCTs including 218 patients showed that oral
      immunotherapy, compared to elimination diet alone, increased the likelihood of
      achieving full tolerance of cow's milk [relative risk: 10.0 (95% CI: 4.1-24.2)]. 
      Adverse effects of immunotherapy include frequent local symptoms (16% of doses), 
      mild laryngospasm [relative risk: 12.9 (1.7-98.6)], mild asthma [rate ratio: 3.8 
      (2.9-5.0)], reactions requiring oral glucocorticosteroids [relative risk: 11.3
      (2.7-46.5)] or intramuscular epinephrine injection [rate ratio 5.8 (1.6-21.9)].
      Results of observational studies were consistent with those of RCTs. Despite the 
      availability of RCTs, the overall low quality of evidence leaves important
      uncertainty about anticipated effects of immunotherapy due to very serious
      imprecision of the estimates of effects and the likelihood of publication bias
      for some of the critical outcomes. A potentially large benefit of oral
      immunotherapy in patients with cow's milk allergy may be counterbalanced by
      frequent and sometimes serious adverse effects. Additional, larger RCTs measuring
      all patient-important outcomes are still needed.

TI  - Asthma and other recurrent wheezing disorders in children (chronic).
LID - 0302 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Childhood asthma is the most common chronic paediatric illness.
      There is no cure for asthma but good treatment to palliate symptoms is available.
      Asthma is more common in children with a personal or family history of atopy,
      increased severity and frequency of wheezing episodes, and presence of variable
      airway obstruction or bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Precipitating factors for
      symptoms and acute episodes include infection, house dust mites, allergens from
      pet animals, exposure to tobacco smoke, and exercise. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We
      conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical
      questions: What are the effects of single-agent prophylaxis in children taking
      as-needed inhaled beta(2) agonists for asthma? What are the effects of additional
      prophylactic treatments in childhood asthma inadequately controlled by
      standard-dose inhaled corticosteroids? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane
      Library, and other important databases up to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews
      are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date
      version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations
      such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and
      Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 48 systematic
      reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We
      performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the
      effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta(2) agonists
      (long-acting), corticosteroids (inhaled standard or higher doses), leukotriene
      receptor antagonists (oral), omalizumab, and theophylline (oral).

TI  - Perinatal cat and dog exposure and the risk of asthma and allergy in the urban
      environment: a systematic review of longitudinal studies.
PG  - 176484
LID - 10.1155/2012/176484 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The literature is contradictory concerning pet exposure and the risk 
      of development of asthma and other allergic diseases. Using longitudinal studies,
      we aimed to systematically review the impact of pet ownership in the critical
      perinatal period as a risk factor for allergies in childhood. METHODS: Medline
      database was searched for urban cohort studies with perinatal exposure to cats
      and/or dogs and subsequent asthma or allergic disease. RESULTS: Nine articles,
      comprising 6498 participants, met inclusion criteria. Six found a reduction in
      allergic disease associated with perinatal exposure to dogs or, cats or dogs. One
      study found no association. Two found increased risk only in high-risk groups.
      CONCLUSION: Longitudinal studies in urban populations suggest that perinatal
      pets, especially dogs, may reduce the development of allergic disease in those
      without a family history of allergy. Other unmeasured factors such as pet-keeping
      choices in allergic families may be confounding the association seen in these
      high-risk families, and further study is required.

LID - 0300 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute childhood asthma is a common clinical emergency presenting
      across a range of ages and with a range of severities. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We
      conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical
      question: What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma in children? We
      searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up
      to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check
      our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms
      alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
      RESULTS: We found 35 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met 
      our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of
      evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present
      information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following
      interventions: beta2 agonists (high-dose nebulised, metered-dose inhaler plus
      spacer device versus nebuliser, intravenous), corticosteroids (systemic,
      high-dose inhaled), ipratropium bromide (single- or multiple-dose inhaled),
      magnesium sulphate, oxygen, and theophylline or aminophylline.

TI  - [Evaluation of efficacy and safety of loratadine in the treatment of childhood
      asthma].
PG  - 873-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of loratadine, a new generation of
      antihistaminics, in the treatment of childhood asthma. METHODS: The papers
      related to loratadine treatment for childhood asthma were searched in the
      database of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrance, CNKI and CBMdisc (January 1990 to
      December 2010) electronically and manually. According to the Cochrane reviewer's 
      handbook, the quality of the enrolled papers was assessed and a systematic review
      was performed. RESULTS: A total of 179 papers were obtained. Eleven randomized
      controlled trials met the criteria and were included in this study. The 11 trials
      included 317 children with asthma: 159 cases in the loratadine treatment group
      and 158 cases in the control group. All included studies belonged to the B class 
      according to the quality evaluation criteria. Meta analysis showed that the
      clinical symptoms were improved more, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second
      (FEV1) 4 and 8 weeks posttreatment and the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) 8
      weeks posttreatment were higher in the loratadine treatment group than in the
      control group. The treatment-related adverse effects, fatigue, tachycardia and
      palpitation, occurred less in the loratadine treatment group compared with the
      control group. CONCLUSIONS: Loratadine is safe and effective for the treatment of
      childhood asthma.

PG  - 627-41
LID - 10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00445.x [doi]
AB  - Recent findings suggest a significant association between the antioxidant status 
      of pregnant women and of their children during the first years of life and the
      development of allergic disease during childhood. The aim of this review was to
      identify all studies that estimated the effect of intake of antioxidants in
      pregnant women and their children on the development of allergic disease during
      early childhood. A systematic review was conducted of epidemiological studies
      featuring original peer-reviewed data on the association between dietary
      antioxidant status and allergic disease during childhood. A systematic search was
      performed following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
      Guidelines. A comprehensive search of the literature yielded 225 studies, 18 of
      which were selected for the extraction of results and were related to antioxidant
      status and allergic disease. The systematic review included five prospective
      cohort studies, four cross-sectional studies, and nine case-control studies.
      Eight studies reported an important association between antioxidant status and
      asthma onset during childhood. Similarly, wheezing and eczema were studied as an 
      outcome in six and in five studies, respectively. Recent observational studies
      suggest that a higher intake of antioxidant vitamins, zinc, and selenium during
      pregnancy and childhood reduces the likelihood of childhood asthma, wheezing, and
      eczema.

      Here we report the results of a systematic review of published literature in
      order to provide a more comprehensive picture of this relationship. After a
      literature search, we identified seven studies providing quantitative results
      regarding the association between formaldehyde exposure and asthma in children.
      Studies were heterogeneous with respect to the definition of asthma. For each
      study, an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for asthma were
      abstracted from published results or calculated based on the data provided. We
      used fixed- and random-effects models to calculate pooled ORs and 95% CIs;
      measures of heterogeneity were also calculated. A fixed-effects model produced an
      OR of 1.03 (95% CI, 1.021.04), and random effects model produced an OR of 1.17
      (95% CI, 1.011.36), both reflecting an increase of 10 mg/m3 of formaldehyde. Both
      the Q and I2 statistics indicated a moderate amount of heterogeneity. Results
      indicate a positive association between formaldehyde exposure and childhood
      asthma. Given the largely cross-sectional nature of the studies underlying this
      meta-analysis, further well-designed prospective epidemiologic studies are
      needed.

AB  - There is conflicting evidence concerning the relationship between breast feeding 
      and wheezing illness. The objective of this study was to investigate whether
      there is any association between breast feeding and wheezing in children aged
      over 5 years and to discover possible sources of heterogeneity. An electronic
      search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was conducted from January 2000 to June
      2010. In addition, reference lists from relevant publications were searched.
      Birth cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies were included if they
      measured any breast feeding or exclusive breast feeding for 3 or 4 months.
      Wheezing illness, including asthma, was identified based on symptoms, reported
      diagnosis or objective criteria. Thirty-one publications were identified for
      meta-analysis. There was no association found between any or exclusive breast
      feeding and wheezing illness, although there was a high level of heterogeneity
      between the studies. Subgroup analysis revealed that any breast feeding slightly 
      lowers the odds of wheeze (pooled odds ratio 0.92 [0.86, 0.98]) but slightly
      increases the odds of asthma defined by specific criteria (pooled odds ratio 1.10
      [1.00, 1.22]). This meta-analysis does not provide evidence that breast feeding
      is protective against wheezing illness in children aged 5 years and over. The
      difference in the effects of breast feeding according to the nature of the
      wheezing illness highlights the importance of the heterogeneity of illness
      phenotypes.

TI  - The effect of financial incentives on the quality of health care provided by
      primary care physicians.
PG  - CD008451
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD008451.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of blended payment schemes in primary care, including the use
      of financial incentives to directly reward 'performance' and 'quality' is
      increasing in a number of countries. There are many examples in the US, and the
      Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) for general practitioners (GPs) in the UK is
      an example of a major system-wide reform. Despite the popularity of these
      schemes, there is currently little rigorous evidence of their success in
      improving the quality of primary health care, or of whether such an approach is
      cost-effective relative to other ways to improve the quality of care. OBJECTIVES:
      The aim of this review is to examine the effect of changes in the method and
      level of payment on the quality of care provided by primary care physicians
      (PCPs) and to identify:i) the different types of financial incentives that have
      improved quality;ii) the characteristics of patient populations for whom quality 
      of care has been improved by financial incentives; andiii) the characteristics of
      PCPs who have responded to financial incentives. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the
      Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Trials Register,
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database of
      Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, EMBASE,
      CINAHL, PsychLIT, and ECONLIT. Searches of Internet-based economics and health
      economics working paper collections were also conducted. Finally, studies were
      identified through the reference lists of retrieved articles, websites of key
      organisations, and from direct contact with key authors in the field. Articles
      were included if they were published from 2000 to August 2009. SELECTION
      CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before and after studies
      (CBA), and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) evaluating the impact of
      different financial interventions on the quality of care delivered by primary
      healthcare physicians (PCPs). Quality of care was defined as patient reported
      outcome measures, clinical behaviours, and intermediate clinical and
      physiological measures. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors
      independently extracted data and assessed study quality, in consultation with two
      other review authors where there was disagreement. For each included study, we
      reported the estimated effect sizes and confidence intervals. MAIN RESULTS: Seven
      studies were included in this review. Three of the studies evaluated
      single-threshold target payments, one examined a fixed fee per patient achieving 
      a specified outcome, one study evaluated payments based on the relative ranking
      of medical groups' performance (tournament-based pay), one study examined a mix
      of tournament-based pay and threshold payments, and one study evaluated changing 
      from a blended payments scheme to salaried payment. Three cluster RCTs examined
      smoking cessation; one CBA examined patients' assessment of the quality of care; 
      one CBA examined cervical screening, mammography screening, and HbA1c; one ITS
      focused on four outcomes in diabetes; and one controlled ITS (a
      difference-in-difference design) examined cervical screening, mammography
      screening, HbA1c, childhood immunisation, chlamydia screening, and appropriate
      asthma medication. Six of the seven studies showed positive but modest effects on
      quality of care for some primary outcome measures, but not all. One study found
      no effect on quality of care. Poor study design led to substantial risk of bias
      in most studies. In particular, none of the studies addressed issues of selection
      bias as a result of the ability of primary care physicians to select into or out 
      of the incentive scheme or health plan. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The use of
      financial incentives to reward PCPs for improving the quality of primary
      healthcare services is growing. However, there is insufficient evidence to
      support or not support the use of financial incentives to improve the quality of 
      primary health care. Implementation should proceed with caution and incentive
      schemes should be more carefully designed before implementation. In addition to
      basing incentive design more on theory, there is a large literature discussing
      experiences with these schemes that can be used to draw out a number of lessons
      that can be learned and that could be used to influence or modify the design of
      incentive schemes. More rigorous study designs need to be used to account for the
      selection of physicians into incentive schemes. The use of instrumental variable 
      techniques should be considered to assist with the identification of treatment
      effects in the presence of selection bias and other sources of unobserved
      heterogeneity. In randomised trials, care must be taken in using the correct unit
      of analysis and more attention should be paid to blinding. Studies should also
      examine the potential unintended consequences of incentive schemes by having a
      stronger theoretical basis, including a broader range of outcomes, and conducting
      more extensive subgroup analysis. Studies should more consistently describe i)
      the type of payment scheme at baseline or in the control group, ii) how payments 
      to medical groups were used and distributed within the groups, and iii) the size 
      of the new payments as a percentage of total revenue. Further research comparing 
      the relative costs and effects of financial incentives with other behaviour
      change interventions is also required.

PG  - 916-25
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2010.02846.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (n-3 PUFA) may modulate immune responses and allergy in neonates and children.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine if n-3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy and
      lactation reduces risk for childhood allergic disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: We
      searched Medline and all evidence-based medicine reviews for randomised
      controlled trials comparing the effects of n-3 PUFA and placebo supplementation
      during pregnancy and/or lactation on childhood allergic diseases and inflammatory
      cytokines. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies reporting on food allergy,
      response to the egg skin prick test (SPT), atopy and asthma in infancy and
      childhood as well as production of interleukin-13 and interferon-gamma, two
      cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. For assessment of inclusion,
      two authors reviewed all abstracts for suitability and independently extracted
      data. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two-by-two tables were constructed and odds
      ratios (OR) were calculated for the outcomes: response to the SPT, food allergy, 
      atopy and asthma in childhood. The assays differed so data on inflammatory
      markers were reported in narrative form. MAIN RESULTS: Five randomised controlled
      trials (n = 949) were included. n-3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy reduced
      12-month prevalence of positive egg SPT (two trials, 12/87 versus 32/100, OR
      0.33, 95% CI 0.16, 0.70) and childhood asthma (two trials, 10/303 versus 17/179, 
      OR 0.349, 95% CI 0.154, 0.788) and significantly reduced cord blood
      interleukin-13 levels. Supplementation during lactation did not prevent asthma,
      food allergy or atopy. CONCLUSION: n-3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy
      decreases childhood asthma and response to SPT.

      systematic review.
PG  - 1125-38
LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-2092 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The increasing prevalence of childhood asthma has been associated with
      low microbial exposure as described by the hygiene hypothesis. OBJECTIVE: We
      sought to evaluate the evidence of association between antibiotic exposure during
      pregnancy or in the first year of life and risk of childhood asthma. METHODS:
      PubMed was systematically searched for studies published between 1950 and July 1,
      2010. Those that assessed associations between antibiotic exposure during
      pregnancy or in the first year of life and asthma at ages 0 to 18 years (for
      pregnancy exposures) or ages 3 to 18 years (for first-year-of-life exposures)
      were included. Validity was assessed according to study design, age at asthma
      diagnosis, adjustment for respiratory infections, and consultation rates.
      RESULTS: For exposure in the first year of life, the pooled odds ratio (OR) for
      all studies (N = 20) was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-1.77).
      Retrospective studies had the highest pooled risk estimate for asthma (OR: 2.04
      [95% CI: 1.83-2.27]; n = 8) compared with database and prospective studies (OR:
      1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.45]; n = 12). Risk estimates for studies that adjusted for
      respiratory infections (pooled OR: 1.16 [95% CI: 1.08-1.25]; n = 5) or later
      asthma onset (pooled OR for asthma at or after 2 years: OR: 1.16 [95% CI:
      1.06-1.25]; n = 3) were weaker but remained significant. For exposure during
      pregnancy (n = 3 studies), the pooled OR was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.02-1.50).
      CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics seem to slightly increase the risk of childhood asthma. 
      Reverse causality and protopathic bias seem to be possible confounders for this
      relationship.

      in children: a systematic review.
PG  - 812-24
LID - 10.1183/09031936.00184010 [doi]
AB  - Critical reviews over the past 10 yrs have found increased respiratory and
      allergic health outcomes for children living in damp and mouldy environments.
      However, recent studies have suggested that early childhood exposure to specific 
      mould components may actually protect children from developing allergy. We
      conducted a systematic review of observational studies published in English from 
      January 1980 to July 2010. This review was conducted according to systematic
      guidelines for Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE).
      The literature was searched using a computerised bibliographic database, PubMed. 
      In order to increase the quality of the reviewed studies, meta-analyses of the
      effects of visible mould exposure on allergic health outcomes were performed and 
      we evaluated the findings according to the Bradford Hill criteria for evidence of
      causation. The literature search identified 1,398 peer-reviewed scientific
      publications, and 61 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included 
      in this review. We observed increased risks of allergic respiratory health
      outcomes in children exposed to visible mould and mould spores. These findings
      were confirmed by the results of the meta-analysis and in line with the
      evaluation criteria according to Bradford Hill. Visible mould was positively
      associated with asthma (OR 1.49 (95% CI 1.28-1.72)), wheeze (OR 1.68 (95% CI
      1.48-1.90)) and allergic rhinitis (OR 1.39 (95% CI 1.28-1.51)). However, there
      was a tendency of lower risk for allergic health outcomes in children exposed to 
      mould-derived components such as (1,3)-beta-d-glucan and extracellular
      polysaccharides. These findings suggest that home environments with visible mould
      and mould spore exposure increase the risk of allergic respiratory health
      outcomes in children. However, further investigations are needed to examine the
      effects of exposure to mould-derived components as the current literature is
      inconclusive. In order to disentangle the different effects of overall microbial 
      exposure on children's health, research should focus on specific microbial
      markers in the home, in combination with new assessment techniques including
      molecular methods.

TI  - The population attributable fraction of asthma among Canadian children.
PG  - 35-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of Canadian
      childhood asthma due to modifiable environmental exposures, in order to estimate 
      their relative contributions to asthma development based on the current
      literature. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to determine Canadian
      childhood asthma incidence, Canadian prevalence of exposure to airborne
      pollutants and indoor allergens, and international estimates of the risk of
      developing physician-diagnosed asthma (PDA) associated with each exposure.
      Combining risk estimates by meta-analysis where possible, PAF was calculated by
      the formula: PAF = Attributable risk *Exposure prevalence* 100%/Asthma incidence.
      SYNTHESIS: Age-specific Canadian childhood asthma incidence ranged from
      2.8%-6.9%. Canadian exposure prevalences were: PM10 16%, PM2.5 7.1%, NO2 25%,
      environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) 9.0%, cat 22%, dog 12%, mouse 17%, cockroach
      9.8%, dust mite 30%, moisture 14% and mould 33%. Relative risk estimates of PDA
      were: PM10 1.64, PM2.5 1.44, NO2 1.29, ETS 1.40, mouse 1.23, cockroach 1.96, and 
      spanned 1.00 for cat, dog, dust mites, moisture and mould. PAF estimates for
      incident asthma among preschool children were: PM10 11%, PM2.5 1.6%, NO2 4.0%,
      ETS 2.9%, mouse 6.5% and cockroach 13%. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review
      suggests contributions to childhood asthma development from exposure to
      particulates, NO2, ETS, mouse and cockroach. The associations appeared to be more
      complex for cat, dog and dust mite allergens and more variable for mould and
      moisture. Additional prospective, population-based studies of childhood asthma
      development with objectively-measured exposures are needed to further quantify
      these associations.

TI  - Paracetamol in pregnancy and the risk of wheezing in offspring: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 482-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2010.03691.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence to suggest that the risk of asthma might be
      increased with exposure to paracetamol in the intrauterine environment, infancy, 
      later childhood and adult life. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence from studies
      investigating the association between paracetamol use in pregnancy and childhood 
      asthma. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken of studies 
      reporting the association between paracetamol use in pregnancy and subsequent
      asthma in childhood. The primary outcome variable was wheeze in the last 12
      months. For tabulated raw data, not adjusted for confounders, random effects odds
      ratios (OR) were pooled by the inverse variance weighted method. RESULTS: There
      were six studies identified that were included in the meta-analysis. The age of
      children studied ranged from 30 to 84 months. The pooled random effects OR for
      the risk of current wheeze in the children of women who were exposed to any
      paracetamol during any stage of pregnancy was 1.21 (95% confidence interval
      1.02-1.44). Features of the studies variably included an association with
      paracetamol use during all trimesters of pregnancy and an association with
      persistent asthma, severe asthma, and with atopy. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL
      RELEVANCE: The use of paracetamol during pregnancy is associated with an
      increased risk of childhood asthma. More research is urgently required to
      determine the impact of paracetamol during pregnancy on the risk of wheezing in
      offspring so that appropriate public health recommendations can be made.

      systematic review.
PG  - 129-38
LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-1223 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the dose-response relationship (benefits and harms) of
      inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in children with persistent asthma. METHODS: We
      conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) that compared >/=2 doses of ICSs in children aged 3 to 18 years with
      persistent asthma. Medline was searched for articles published between 1950 and
      August 2009. Main outcomes of our analyses included morning and evening peak
      expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, asthma symptom score,
      beta(2)-agonist use, withdrawal because of lack of efficacy, and adverse events. 
      Meta-analyses were performed to compare moderate (300-400 mug/day) with low
      (</=200 mug/day beclomethasone-equivalent) doses of ICSs. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs 
      (5768 asthmatic children) that evaluated 5 ICSs were included. The pooled
      standardized mean difference from 6 trials revealed a small but statistically
      significant increase of moderate over low doses in improving forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second (standardized mean difference: 0.11 [95% confidence interval: 
      0.01-0.21]) among children with mild-to-moderate asthma. There was no significant
      difference between 2 doses in terms of other efficacy outcomes. Local adverse
      events were uncommon, and there was no evidence of dose-response relationship at 
      low-to-moderate doses. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with low doses, moderate doses of
      ICSs may not provide clinically relevant therapeutic advantage in children with
      mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. Additional RCTs are needed to clarify the
      dose-response relationship of ICSs in persistent childhood asthma.

TI  - Long-term impact of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence on
      morbidity and premature mortality in adulthood: systematic review.
PG  - 891-8
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2010.222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The last systematic review on the health consequences
      of child and adolescent obesity found little evidence on consequences for adult
      health. The present study aimed to summarize evidence on the long-term impact of 
      child and adolescent obesity for premature mortality and physical morbidity in
      adulthood. METHODS: Systematic review with evidence searched from January 2002 to
      June 2010. Studies were included if they contained a measure of overweight and/or
      obesity between birth and 18 years (exposure measure) and premature mortality and
      physical morbidity (outcome) in adulthood. RESULTS: Five eligible studies
      examined associations between overweight and/or obesity, and premature mortality:
      4/5 found significantly increased risk of premature mortality with child and
      adolescent overweight or obesity. All 11 studies with cardiometabolic morbidity
      as outcomes reported that overweight and obesity were associated with
      significantly increased risk of later cardiometabolic morbidity (diabetes,
      hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and stroke) in adult life, with hazard
      ratios ranging from 1.1-5.1. Nine studies examined associations of child or
      adolescent overweight and obesity with other adult morbidity: studies of cancer
      morbidity were inconsistent; child and adolescent overweight and obesity were
      associated with significantly increased risk of later disability pension, asthma,
      and polycystic ovary syndrome symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively large and
      fairly consistent body of evidence now demonstrates that overweight and obesity
      in childhood and adolescence have adverse consequences on premature mortality and
      physical morbidity in adulthood.

AB  - Asthma and obesity, both of which are considered global health issues, affect
      approximately 300 million individuals worldwide. The observation that asthma and 
      obesity tend to increase in parallel may indicate a potential link between these 
      two conditions. The aim of this systematic review of the literature was to
      investigate the relationship between childhood nutritional status and incidence
      or persistence of asthma during adolescence. The principal eligibility criteria
      for selection of articles were including longitudinal analysis, and which
      measured of exposure during childhood or adolescence and outcome during
      adolescence. The systematic search initially returned 1563 unique articles. After
      inspection of titles and reading the abstracts of these articles, we chose 27 for
      full reading. Of these, 10 were selected to be included in the present review. Of
      the 10 selected studies, eight showed positive associations between
      overweight/obesity and asthma. Of these, two were independent of sex, three were 
      found only among men and another three only among women. The present study shows 
      strong evidence that, although the role of sex is not clear, obesity precedes,
      and is associated with, the persistence and intensity of symptoms of asthma.

TI  - Obesity and asthma: association or coincidence?
PG  - 6-14
LID - 10.2223/JPED.1963 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Asthma and obesity are among the major causes of morbidity in
      childhood and adolescence. Early obesity increases the chances of chronic
      degenerative diseases in adults. Although the concomitance or both clinical
      situations are being demonstrated in various studies, the intrinsic mechanisms of
      this association are still very little known. Therefore, the objective of this
      article was to review the main studies on the association of obesity and asthma
      and check if there is a cause-effect relation between them. SOURCES: Systematic
      review based on indexed data bases MEDLINE (PubMed) and SciELO. Original articles
      (cross-sectional, case-control, and prospective studies) and meta-analysis
      published in the period that ranges from January 1998 to January 2008 were
      reviewed. Studies published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese were researched. 
      SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Although there are various studies on growing prevalence
      of asthma and obesity, few of them establish cause-effect relations between them.
      Physiopathological mechanisms and factors involved in this process are still
      little known. CONCLUSION: Methodological rigor in future studies must seek for
      answers to better understand if there is association between asthma and obesity
      or if the relationship between both diseases is a coincidence.

TI  - Genetic associations with asthma and virus-induced wheezing: a systematic review.
PG  - 1220-6
LID - S1806-37132009001200010 [pii]
AB  - Various wheezing phenotypes can be identified based on differences in natural
      histories, risk factors and responses to treatment. In epidemiologic studies,
      atopic asthma or virus-induced wheezing can be discriminated by the presence or
      the absence of sensitization to allergens. Children with asthma have been shown
      to present lower levels of lung function. Patients with viral respiratory
      infections evolve from normal lung function to enhanced airway reactivity. The
      objective of this study was to identify genes and polymorphisms associated with
      different wheezing phenotypes. Using data obtained from the Genetic Association
      Database, we systematically reviewed studies on genes and polymorphisms that have
      been associated with virus-induced wheezing or atopic asthma. The research was
      carried out in February of 2009. Genes associated with the studied outcomes in
      more than three studies were included in the analysis. We found that different
      genes and loci have been associated with virus-induced wheezing or atopic asthma.
      Virus-induced wheezing has frequently been associated with IL-8 polymorphisms,
      whereas atopic asthma and atopy have frequently been associated with Th2 cytokine
      gene (CD14 and IL-13) polymorphisms on chromosome 5. This review provides
      evidence that different wheezing disorders in childhood can be differently
      affected by genetic variations, considering their role on airway inflammation and
      atopy. Future studies of genetic associations should consider the different
      wheezing phenotypes in infancy. In addition, stratified analyses for atopy can be
      useful for elucidating the mechanisms of the disease.

TI  - Formaldehyde exposure and asthma in children: a systematic review.
PG  - 313-7
LID - 10.1289/ehp.0901143 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite multiple published studies regarding the association between
      formaldehyde exposure and childhood asthma, a consistent association has not been
      identified. Here we report the results of a systematic review of published
      literature in order to provide a more comprehensive picture of this relationship.
      DATA SOURCES: After a comprehensive literature search, we identified seven
      peer-reviewed studies providing quantitative results regarding the association
      between formaldehyde exposure and asthma in children. Studies were heterogeneous 
      with respect to the definition of asthma (e.g., self-report, physician
      diagnosis). Most of the studies were cross-sectional. DATA EXTRACTION: For each
      study, an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for asthma were either
      abstracted from published results or calculated based on the data provided.
      Characteristics regarding the study design and population were also abstracted.
      DATA SYNTHESIS: We used fixed- and random-effects models to calculate pooled ORs 
      and 95% CIs; measures of heterogeneity were also calculated. A fixed-effects
      model produced an OR of 1.03 (95% CI, 1.021.04), and random effects model
      produced an OR of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.011.36), both reflecting an increase of 10
      microg/m3 of formaldehyde. Both the Q and I2 statistics indicated a moderate
      amount of heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a significant positive
      association between formaldehyde exposure and childhood asthma. Given the largely
      cross-sectional nature of the studies underlying this meta-analysis, further
      well-designed prospective epidemiologic studies are needed.

PG  - 2752-61
LID - 10.3390/ijerph6112752 [doi]
AB  - We aimed to provide a summary of the existing published knowledge on the
      association between adverse birth outcomes and the development of wheezing during
      the first two years of life. We carried out a systematic review of
      epidemiological studies within the MEDLINE database. Epidemiological studies on
      human subjects, published in English, were included in the review. A
      comprehensive literature search yielded 72 studies for further consideration.
      Following the application of the eligibility criteria we identified nine studies.
      A positive association and an excess risk of wheezing during the first two years 
      of life were revealed for adverse birth outcomes.

TI  - Atopy risk in infants and children in relation to early exposure to fish, oily
      fish, or long-chain omega-3 fatty acids: a systematic review.
PG  - 36-66
LID - 10.1007/s12016-009-8186-2 [doi]
AB  - There are two main families of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the n-6 and
      the n-3 families. It has been suggested that there is a causal relationship
      between n-6 PUFA intake and allergic disease, and there are biologically
      plausible mechanisms, involving eicosanoid mediators of the n-6 PUFA arachidonic 
      acid, that could explain this. Fish and fish oils are sources of long-chain n-3
      PUFAs and these fatty acids act to oppose the actions of n-6 PUFAs. Thus, it is
      considered that n-3 PUFAs will protect against atopic sensitization and against
      the clinical manifestations of atopy. Evidence to examine this has been acquired 
      from epidemiologic studies investigating associations between fish intake in
      pregnancy, lactation, infancy, and childhood, and atopic outcomes in infants and 
      children and from intervention studies with fish oil supplements in pregnancy,
      lactation, infancy, and childhood, and atopic outcomes in infants and children.
      All five epidemiological studies investigating the effect of maternal fish intake
      during pregnancy on atopic or allergic outcomes in infants/children of those
      pregnancies concluded protective associations. One study investigating the
      effects of maternal fish intake during lactation did not observe any significant 
      associations. The evidence from epidemiological studies investigating the effects
      of fish intake during infancy and childhood on atopic outcomes in those infants
      or children is inconsistent, although the majority of the studies (nine of 14)
      showed a protective effect of fish intake during infancy or childhood on atopic
      outcomes in those infants/children. Fish oil supplementation during pregnancy and
      lactation or during infancy or childhood results in a higher n-3 PUFA status in
      the infants or children. Fish oil provision to pregnant women is associated with 
      immunologic changes in cord blood and such changes may persist. Studies performed
      to date indicate that provision of fish oil during pregnancy may reduce
      sensitization to common food allergens and reduce prevalence and severity of
      atopic dermatitis in the first year of life, with a possible persistence until
      adolescence with a reduction in eczema, hay fever, and asthma. Fish oil provision
      to infants or children may be associated with immunologic changes in the blood
      but it is not clear if these are of clinical significance and whether they
      persist. Fish oil supplementation in infancy may decrease the risk of developing 
      some manifestations of allergic disease, but this benefit may not persist as
      other factors come into play. It is not clear whether fish oil can be used to
      treat children with asthma as the two studies conducted to date give divergent
      results. Further studies of increased long-chain n-3 PUFA provision in during
      pregnancy, lactation, and infancy are needed to more clearly identify the
      immunologic and clinical effects in infants and children and to identify
      protective and therapeutic effects and their persistence.

TI  - Does BCG vaccination protect against the development of childhood asthma? A
      systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies.
PG  - 469-86
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyp307 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results have been conflicting as to whether Bacillus Calmette-Guerin 
      (BCG) vaccine, a non-specific stimulator of the immune function, protects,
      predisposes or is unrelated to the development of childhood asthma. In this
      systematic review and meta-analysis, we qualitatively and quantitatively
      appraised the epidemiological evidence. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified
      using a search strategy that included a computerized literature search and a
      manual search of each article's reference list, up to June 2008. A total of 23
      studies were included (10 cohort, 5 case-control and 8 cross-sectional). Each
      study was summarized and rated for methodological quality. Pooled odds ratio (OR)
      estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed-effects 
      (FE) or random-effects (RE) models; if heterogeneity was present, the latter was 
      used. Three indicators of BCG exposure were considered including BCG vaccination,
      tuberculin response and scar diameter. RESULTS: The pooled estimate of
      association for 23 studies reporting on any of the three indicators suggested a
      protective effect of BCG exposure on childhood asthma occurrence. The studies
      were heterogeneous, especially when tuberculin response was considered.
      Restriction to a subgroup of 16 studies that considered BCG vaccination indicated
      a protective effect with no evidence of heterogeneity. The overall pooled OR
      using an FE model was 0.86 (95% CI 0.79-0.93). Exclusion of three studies with
      the lowest quality scores showed a similar association. CONCLUSION: These results
      strengthen the epidemiological evidence in support of the hypothesis that
      exposure to the BCG vaccine in early life prevents asthma, possibly through a
      modulation of the immune maturation process.

TI  - Mono and multifaceted inhalant and/or food allergen reduction interventions for
      preventing asthma in children at high risk of developing asthma.
PG  - CD006480
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006480.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergen exposure is one of the environmental factors seemingly
      associated with the development of asthma. If asthma is a multi-factorial
      disease, it is hypothesised that prevention might only prove effective if most or
      all relevant environmental factors are simultaneously avoided. OBJECTIVES: To
      assess effect(s) of monofaceted and multifaceted interventions compared with
      control interventions in preventing asthma and asthma symptoms in high risk
      children. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register
      (December 2008). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of allergen
      exposure reduction for the primary prevention of asthma in children.
      Interventions were multifaceted (reducing exposure to both inhalant and food
      allergens) or monofaceted (reducing exposure to either inhalant or food
      allergens) Follow up had to be from birth (or during pregnancy) up to a minimum
      of two years of age. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We included in the analysis
      studies assessing the primary outcome (current diagnosis: asthma) and/or one of
      the secondary outcomes (current respiratory symptoms: wheezing, nocturnal
      coughing and dyspnoea). We pooled multifaceted and monofaceted intervention
      trials separately. We made an indirect comparison of their effects using tests
      for interaction to calculate relative odds ratios. MAIN RESULTS: We included
      three multifaceted and six monofaceted intervention studies (3271 children).
      Physician diagnosed asthma in children less than five years, and asthma as
      defined by respiratory symptoms and lung function criteria in children aged five 
      years and older, both favoured treatment with a multifaceted intervention
      compared to usual care (< 5 years: odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 0.54 to 0.96, and > 5 years: OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85). However, there
      was no significant difference in outcome between monofaceted intervention and
      control interventions (< 5 years: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.64, and > 5 years: OR
      0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.16). Indirect comparison between these treatments did not 
      demonstrate a significant difference between multiple interventions and
      mono-interventions in reducing the frequency of asthma diagnosis in children
      under five years (relative OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.04, P = 0.07) or five years 
      and older (relative OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.13, P = 0.12). There was also no
      significant difference between either mono- and multifaceted intervention and
      control in reducing the likelihood of symptoms of nocturnal coughing at follow
      up. Wheezing, however, showed a significant difference between multifaceted and
      mono-interventions (relative OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, P = 0.04), but the
      significance was lost when data on treatment only was analysed. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that the reduction of exposure to
      multiple allergens compared to usual care reduces the likelihood of a current
      diagnosis of asthma in children (at ages < 5 years and 5 years and older).
      Mono-intervention studies have not produced effects which are statistically
      significant compared with control. In children who are at risk of developing
      childhood asthma, multifaceted interventions, characterised by dietary allergen
      reduction and environmental remediation, reduce the odds of a physician diagnosis
      of asthma later in childhood by half. This translates to a number needed to treat
      (NNT) of 17. The effect of multi-faceted interventions on parent reported wheeze 
      was inconsistent and had no significant impact on nocturnal coughing or dyspnoea.
      Data from monofaceted intervention exposed children studies were not
      significantly different from those of control groups for all outcomes. There
      remains uncertainty as to whether multiple interventions are more effective than 
      mono-component interventions. The comparisons made were indirect, making the
      conclusions drawn uncertain. To our knowledge there are no ongoing studies in
      which both intervention strategies are randomly compared. The findings, however, 
      warrant further direct comparison between multiple- and monofaceted interventions
      aimed at reducing the prevalence of asthma in children.

AB  - Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease in children. To quantify the
      national prevalence of asthma symptoms in Iranian children, we conducted a
      systematic review and meta-analysis. After internet and hand searching for
      population-based prevalence estimates published from 1998 to 2003 from 142
      articles, dissertations and reports of research projects, 19 of them were
      selected. All the selected studies on children had been performed by the
      International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) protocol. We
      analyzed the data using NCSS software. In the included 19 studies, 61,067
      children in different age groups had been examined by the ISAAC protocol. The
      lowest prevalence of asthma symptoms was 2.7% in Kerman and the highest was 35.4%
      in Tehran (capital of Iran). Overall prevalence of asthma symptoms at a national 
      level was estimated as 13.14% (95% CI: 9.97-16.30%). Based on this study, the
      prevalence of asthma symptoms in Iran is higher than that estimated in the
      international reports. This information can be used to help prioritize asthma
      prevention and control within the range of Iranian public health concerns.

TI  - Interventions for educating children who are at risk of asthma-related emergency 
      department attendance.
PG  - CD001290
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD001290.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness and is a leading 
      cause for paediatric admission to hospital. Asthma management for children
      results in substantial costs. There is evidence to suggest that hospital
      admissions could be reduced with effective education for parents and children
      about asthma and its management. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of
      the literature and update the previous review as to whether asthma education
      leads to improved health outcomes in children who have attended the emergency
      room for asthma. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials
      Register, including the MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases, and reference lists
      of trials and review articles (last search May 2008). SELECTION CRITERIA: We
      included randomised controlled trials of asthma education for children who had
      attended the emergency department for asthma, with or without hospitalisation,
      within the previous 12 months. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors
      independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study
      authors for additional information. We pooled dichotomous data with a
      fixed-effect risk ratio. We used a random-effects risk ratio for sensitivity
      analysis of heterogenous data. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 38 studies involving 7843
      children were included. Following educational intervention delivered to children,
      their parents or both, there was a significantly reduced risk of subsequent
      emergency department visits (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.81, N = 3008) and hospital
      admissions (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92, N = 4019) compared with control. There 
      were also fewer unscheduled doctor visits (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.81, N =
      1009). Very few data were available for other outcomes (FEV1, PEF, rescue
      medication use, quality of life or symptoms) and there was no statistically
      significant difference between education and control. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
      Asthma education aimed at children and their carers who present to the emergency 
      department for acute exacerbations can result in lower risk of future emergency
      department presentation and hospital admission. There remains uncertainty as to
      the long-term effect of education on other markers of asthma morbidity such as
      quality of life, symptoms and lung function. It remains unclear as to what type, 
      duration and intensity of educational packages are the most effective in reducing
      acute care utilisation.

TI  - Systematic review of worldwide variations of the prevalence of wheezing symptoms 
      in children.
PG  - 57
LID - 10.1186/1476-069X-7-57 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Considerable variation in the prevalence of childhood asthma and its 
      symptoms (wheezing) has been observed in previous studies and there is evidence
      that the prevalence has been increasing over time. METHODS: We have
      systematically reviewed the reported prevalence and time trends of wheezing
      symptoms among children, worldwide and within the same country over time. All
      studies comprising more than 1000 persons and meeting certain other quality
      criteria published over a 16-year period, between January 1990 and December 2005,
      are reported and a comparison of ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and
      Allergies in Childhood) and non-ISAAC studies is made, in part as a way of
      expanding the power to examine time trends (the older studies tend to be
      non-ISAAC), but also to examine possible methodological differences between ISAAC
      and non-ISAAC questions. RESULTS: A wide range of current prevalence of wheeze
      was observed between and within countries over time. The UK had the highest
      recorded prevalence of 32.2% in children aged 13-14 in 1994-5 and Ethiopia had
      the lowest prevalence, 1.7% in children aged 10-19 in 1996. All studies in
      Australia and the UK were compared using multiple logistic regression. ISAAC
      phase I and III studies reported significantly higher prevalence of current
      wheeze (OR = 1.638) compared with non-ISAAC studies, after adjusting for various 
      other factors (country, survey year, age of child, parental vs child response to 
      the survey). Australia showed a significantly higher prevalence of current
      wheezing (OR = 1.343) compared with the UK, there was a significant increase in
      the prevalence odds ratio per survey year (2.5% per year), a significant decrease
      per age of child (0.7% per year), and a significantly higher response in current 
      wheezing if the response was self-completed by the child (OR = 1.290). These
      factors, when explored separately for ISAAC and non-ISAAC studies, showed very
      different results. In ISAAC studies, or non-ISAAC studies using ISAAC questions, 
      there was a significant decrease in current wheezing prevalence over time (2.5%
      per year). In non-ISAAC studies, which tend to cover an earlier period, there was
      a significant increase (2.6% per year) in current wheezing prevalence over time. 
      This is very likely to be a result of prevalence of wheezing increasing from the 
      1970s up to the early 1990s, but decreasing since then. CONCLUSION: The UK has
      the highest recorded prevalence of wheezing and Ethiopia the lowest. Prevalence
      of wheezing in Australia and the UK has increased from the 1970s up to the early 
      1990s, but decreased since then and ISAAC studies report significantly higher
      prevalences than non-ISAAC studies.

TI  - Inhaled sodium cromoglycate for asthma in children.
PG  - CD002173
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD002173.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium cromoglycate has been recommended as maintenance treatment for
      childhood asthma for many years. Its use has decreased since 1990, when inhaled
      corticosteroids became popular, but it is still used in many countries.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of sodium cromoglycate compared to placebo 
      in the prophylactic treatment of children with asthma. SEARCH STRATEGY: We
      searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register (October 2007), the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3,
      2007), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (January 1985 to November 
      2007) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted the pharmaceutical
      company manufacturing sodium cromoglycate. In 2007 we updated the review.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trials, which
      addressed the effectiveness of inhaled sodium cromoglycate as maintenance
      therapy, studying children aged 0 up to 18 years with asthma. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We
      pooled study results. MAIN RESULTS: Of 3500 titles retrieved from the literature,
      24 papers reporting on 23 studies could be included in the review. The studies
      were published between 1970 and 1997 and together included 1026 participants.
      Most were cross-over studies. Few studies provided sufficient information to
      judge the concealment of allocation. Four studies provided results for the
      percentage of symptom-free days. Pooling the results did not reveal a
      statistically significant difference between sodium cromoglycate and placebo. For
      the other pooled outcomes, most of the symptom-related outcomes and
      bronchodilator use showed statistically significant results, but treatment
      effects were small. Considering the confidence intervals of the outcome measures,
      a clinically relevant effect of sodium cromoglycate cannot be excluded. The
      funnel plot showed an under-representation of small studies with negative
      results, suggesting publication bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient
      evidence to be sure about the efficacy of sodium cromoglycate over placebo.
      Publication bias is likely to have overestimated the beneficial effects of sodium
      cromoglycate as maintenance therapy in childhood asthma.

PG  - 108-15
LID - 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2008.05.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of children with
      Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) in comparison with adult patients. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A systematic literature analysis was performed in the Medline database
      up to November 2007 and in rheumatology and pulmonology meeting scientific
      abstracts 2003-2007. Articles with reported childhood CSS cases were retrieved;
      clinical data were recorded. Descriptive statistical analyses and a comparison
      with 2 published adult CSS cohorts were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-three cases of
      childhood CSS were identified. The mean age was 12 years and the male-to-female
      ratio was 0.74. All patients had significant eosinophilia and asthma.
      Histological evidence of eosinophilia and/or vasculitis was present in virtually 
      all patients. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were found in 25% of children
      with CSS. Initial treatment was corticosteroid monotherapy in 76% of childhood
      CSS patients, while 24% received additional immunosuppressive therapy. Another
      18% required further immunosuppression at follow-up due to frequent relapses. Six
      deaths (18%), all related to the underlying disease, occurred after a mean
      disease duration of 14 months. As compared with adult CSS patients, children had 
      a predominance of cardiopulmonary disease manifestations, a lower rate of
      peripheral nerve involvement, and higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Many aspects of 
      CSS are similar in childhood and adult patients. However, pulmonary and cardiac
      involvement is predominant in pediatric CSS and mortality is substantial.

TI  - Diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis: a systematic review.
PG  - 754-65
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.08412.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) has a wide spectrum of dermatological
      manifestations and despite various validated sets of diagnostic criteria that
      have been developed over the past decades, there is disagreement about its
      definition. Nevertheless, clinical studies require valid diagnostic criteria for 
      reliable and reproducible results. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the evidence
      concerning the validity of diagnostic criteria for AD. METHODS: All data sources 
      were identified through searches on Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases. The
      Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy tool (QUADAS) was used. Results are
      presented in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot. RESULTS: Out of the 
      20 articles that met the criteria, 27 validation studies were identified. In two 
      studies concerning Hanifin and Rajka diagnostic criteria sensitivity and
      specificity ranged from 87.9% to 96.0% and from 77.6% to 93.8%, respectively.
      Nineteen validation studies of the U.K. diagnostic criteria showed sensitivity
      and specificity ranging from 10% to 100% and 89.3% to 99.1%, respectively. Three 
      validation studies concerning the Schultz-Larsen criteria showed sensitivity from
      88% to 94.4% and specificity from 77.6% to 95.9%. In one article concerning the
      criteria of Diepgen, the sensitivity ranged from 83.0% to 87.7% and the
      specificity from 83.9% to 87.0%. One article studied the Kang and Tian criteria
      and reported 95.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity. One article validating the
      International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) criteria showed 
      a positive and negative predictive value of 48.8% and 91.1%, respectively.
      CONCLUSION: With this systematic review of the existing sets of diagnostic
      criteria for AD a varying number of validation studies with varying
      methodological quality was found. The U.K. diagnostic criteria are the most
      extensively validated. However, improvement of methodological design for
      validation studies and uniformity in well-validated and applicable diagnostic
      criteria are needed to improve future intervention studies and to compare study
      results.

TI  - Mycobacterial infection and atopy in childhood: a systematic review.
PG  - 551-9
AB  - The epidemiological relation between mycobacterial infection and the prevalence
      of atopic disease in humans is still unclear. This is in contrast to studies in
      murine models in which a clear suppression of atopic symptoms was observed after 
      exposure to mycobacteria or mycobacterial products. We therefore wanted to
      provide a systematic overview of the published literature on the relationship
      between mycobacterial infection and atopic disease and to evaluate the causal
      relationship in a meta-analysis. The EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched
      systematically for papers published in the English literature (1966-2005) on the 
      relation between mycobacterial infection and atopic disease. Original
      observational or interventional studies involving the paediatric population were 
      included. Two authors independently reviewed articles for data on mycobacterial
      exposure and atopic disease outcome. Any differences were resolved by discussion.
      Of a total of 1201 hits, 23 studies (19 cross-sectionals, three case-controls and
      one prospective cohort) met the inclusion criteria. Only a minority of studies
      (40%) observed an association between mycobacterial infection and the prevalence 
      of atopic disease outcome. In the meta-analysis, only studies containing data on 
      mycobacterial exposure and atopic disease outcome variables were included. Only
      cross-sectional studies, in which the relation between a positive tuberculin skin
      test and allergic symptoms was studied, observed statistically significant
      negative correlation (odds ratio 0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.79). The
      results of this review show that the evidence of the relationship of
      mycobacterial infection and atopic disease is based on observations of
      cross-sectional studies. In a meta-analysis, calculations showed a high level of 
      heterogeneity (I(2)) within studies with similar design making it difficult to
      pool effects. This may partly be explained by differences in the type and
      definition of mycobacterial infection and lack of uniformity in the definition of
      atopy. The results show that only a minority of studies in the literature shows
      any evidence of inverse relationship between mycobacterial exposure and atopic
      disease outcome. The fact that the present epidemiological evidence on the
      relationship between mycobacterial infection and the development of atopic
      disease is based mainly on cross-sectional observational studies indicates the
      need for population-based prospective studies to address this issue. This issue
      needs to be addressed in view of recent suggestions to developing
      mycobacterial-based vaccines against atopic disease in the future.

TI  - The association between respiratory syncytial virus infection and the development
      of childhood asthma: a systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 733-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relation between early respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
      infection and later emergence of episodes of wheezing/asthma remains a subject of
      debate. We carried out a systematic review of studies of the association between 
      RSV infection in the first 36 months of life and the subsequent development of
      asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity. METHODS: A literature search for original
      studies on RSV respiratory infection published in English or Spanish over the
      last 21 years was conducted in the bibliographic databases Medline, Embase, and
      Indice Medico Espanol, and in the Cochrane library. Articles were included if
      they described original studies of confirmed RSV infection in children under 3
      years of age, and had defined outcome variables. The methodologic quality of
      articles included in the review was evaluated according to the Hadorn criteria.
      RESULTS: The review included 12 original articles that respond to the research
      question. The studies evaluated showed that RSV lower respiratory tract infection
      is associated with an increased risk for subsequent development of
      asthma/recurrent wheezing, and that this association becomes progressively
      smaller with increasing age. CONCLUSION: On the basis of this systematic review
      of the literature, it can be concluded that a significant association exists
      between RSV infection in childhood and the long-term development of subsequent
      episodes of recurrent wheezing or asthma. However, the methodologic quality of
      the articles evaluated is limited, and hence additional studies are needed,
      ideally, with specific therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing RSV
      replication.

TI  - Risk of developing asthma in young children with atopic eczema: a systematic
      review.
PG  - 565-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is commonly believed that the majority of infants and young
      children with early atopic eczema will develop asthma in later childhood. This
      belief is mainly based on cross-sectional population studies. Recent evidence
      suggests a more complex relationship between early eczema and asthma. OBJECTIVE: 
      This systematic review was conducted to assess the risk of developing asthma in
      children with atopic eczema during the first 4 years of life. METHODS: A
      sensitive search was performed to identify all prospective cohort studies on the 
      topic. By pooling the eligible reports, we calculated the risk of developing
      asthma at 6 years of age or older in children with atopic eczema in the first 4
      years of life. RESULTS: Thirteen prospective cohort studies were included, with 4
      representing birth cohort studies and 9 representing eczema cohort studies. The
      pooled odds ratio for the risk of asthma after eczema, compared with children
      without eczema, in birth cohort studies was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.67-2.75). The
      prevalence of asthma at the age of 6 years in eczema cohort studies was 35.8%
      (95% CI, 32.2% to 39.9%) for inpatients and 29.5% (95% CI, 28.2% to 32.7%) for a 
      combined group of inpatients and outpatients. CONCLUSION: Although there is an
      increased risk of developing asthma after eczema in early childhood, only 1 in
      every 3 children with eczema develops asthma during later childhood. This is
      lower than previously assumed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results may have
      important consequences for counseling patients with atopic eczema and their
      parents.

TI  - WITHDRAWN: Cow's milk protein avoidance and development of childhood wheeze in
      children with a family history of atopy.
PG  - CD003795
AB  - BACKGROUND: In infants with a family history of atopy, food allergen avoidance
      has been advocated as means of preventing the development of atopic disease, when
      breast-feeding is not possible or supplemental feeding is needed. Most infant
      formulas are based on cow's milk protein. Alternative choices include soya based 
      and hydrolysed cows milk formulas. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effect of dietary 
      avoidance of cow's milk protein on the development of asthma or wheeze in
      children. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane database for eligible trials 
      until February 2002. We obtained the full text papers of all abstracts identified
      as RCTs and two reviewers independently reviewed them. SELECTION CRITERIA: We
      included randomised controlled trials involving children with a family history of
      atopy in at least one first degree relative, if feeding with cow's milk based
      standard formula was compared to dietary avoidance of cow's milk protein, using
      soya or other hypoallergenic formula during the initial four months of life or
      longer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers extracted data independently.
      A priori defined subgroups were the types of hypoallergenic artificial feed and
      dietary restrictions on mother and/or child's diet. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials used
      hydrolysed formula for at least four months, in addition to dietary restrictions 
      and in some cases dust-mite reduction measures. The risk of infants experiencing 
      asthma or wheeze during the first year of life was reduced compared to standard
      cow's milk based formula (Relative Risk 0.40, 95% Confidence Intervals 0.19 to
      0.85). Feeding soya-based formula as opposed to standard cow's milk formula did
      not reduce the risk of having asthma or wheeze at any age. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: 
      Breast-milk should remain the feed of choice for all babies. In infants with at
      least one first degree relative with atopy, hydrolysed formula for a minimum of
      four months combined with dietary restrictions and environment measures may
      reduce the risk of developing asthma or wheeze in the first year of life. There
      is insufficient evidence to suggest that soya-based milk formula has any benefit.

TI  - Sodium cromoglicate: an ineffective drug or meta-analysis misused?
PG  - 123-37
AB  - Sodium cromoglicate (SCG) has been available since around 1970 for the treatment 
      of asthma and other allergic disorders in both adults and children. It has been
      approved for use around the world. Over the period of its development, a number
      of different formulations were introduced. In 1999, a systematic review of SCG
      use in childhood asthma was carried out and reported initially as a poster.
      Further systematic reviews and papers followed from the same authors and finally 
      a Cochrane Collaboration review was published in 2003. All concluded that SCG was
      ineffective in paediatric asthma. Both the British Thoracic Society Guidelines
      for the treatment of paediatric asthma and the Model List of Essential Drugs of
      the WHO now reflect these conclusions. This paper looks carefully at the
      conclusions of these systematic reviews and raises concerns about the
      interpretation of the results. These failed to take adequate account of the
      changes with time in both the formulations used and the age groups examined, and 
      also failed to take adequate note of the totality of information available over
      all end-points. One primary end-point was based on only four out of the 24
      studies included in the review. Rather than having no effect, it is demonstrated 
      that a considerable body of evidence favours SCG compared to placebo and, far
      from being ineffective, the drug appears to be effective particularly in older
      children. This article replaces a previously published version. DOI:

TI  - Homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments: systematic review of
      randomized clinical trials.
PG  - 69-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of any type of therapeutic or preventive
      intervention testing homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments. METHODS: 
      Systematic literature searches were conducted through January 2006 in MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, British Homeopathic Library,
      ClinicalTrials.gov, and the UK National Research Register. Bibliographies were
      checked for further relevant publications. Studies were selected according to
      predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All double-blind, placebo-controlled
      randomized clinical trials of any homeopathic intervention for preventing or
      treating childhood and adolescence ailments were included. According to the
      classification of the World Health Organization, the age range defined for
      inclusion was 0 to 19 years. Study selection, data extraction, and assessment of 
      methodological quality were performed independently by 2 reviewers. RESULTS: A
      total of 326 articles were identified, 91 of which were retrieved for detailed
      evaluation. Sixteen trials that assessed 9 different conditions were included in 
      the study. With the exception of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and
      acute childhood diarrhea (each tested in 3 trials), no condition was assessed in 
      more than 2 double-blind randomized clinical trials. The evidence for
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and acute childhood diarrhea is mixed,
      showing both positive and negative results for their respective main outcome
      measures. For adenoid vegetation, asthma, and upper respiratory tract infection
      each, 2 trials are available that suggest no difference compared with placebo.
      For 4 conditions, only single trials are available. CONCLUSION: The evidence from
      rigorous clinical trials of any type of therapeutic or preventive intervention
      testing homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments is not convincing
      enough for recommendations in any condition.

TI  - Soy formula for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants.
PG  - CD003741
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergies and food reactions in infants and children are common and
      may be associated with a variety of foods including adapted cow's milk formula.
      Soy based formulas have been used to treat infants with allergy or food
      intolerance. However, it is unclear whether they can help prevent allergy and
      food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food
      intolerance. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of feeding adapted soy formula
      compared to human milk, cow's milk formula or a hydrolysed protein formula on
      preventing allergy or food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of
      allergy or food intolerance. SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of the
      Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. Updated searches were performed of the
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library,
      Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966-March 2006), EMBASE (1980-March 2006), CINAHL
      (1982-March 2006) and previous reviews including cross references. SELECTION
      CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use of an
      adapted soy formula to human milk, an adapted cow's milk or a hydrolysed protein 
      formula for feeding infants without clinical allergy or food intolerance in the
      first six months of life. Only trials with > 80% follow up of participants and
      reported in group of assignment were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data
      extraction were assessed independently by each review author. Primary outcomes
      included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Where no
      heterogeneity of treatment effect was found, the fixed effect model was used for 
      meta-analysis. Where significant or apparent heterogeneity was found, results
      were reported using the random effects model and potential causes of the
      heterogeneity were sought. MAIN RESULTS: Three eligible studies enrolling high
      risk infants with a history of allergy in a first degree relative were included. 
      No eligible study enrolled infants fed human milk. No study examined the effect
      of early, short term soy formula feeding. All compared prolonged soy formula to
      cow's milk formula feeding. One study was of adequate methodology and without
      unbalanced allergy preventing co-interventions in treatment groups. One study
      with unclear allocation concealment and 19.5% losses reported a significant
      reduction in infant allergy, asthma and allergic rhinitis. However, no other
      study reported any significant benefits from the use of a soy formula.
      Meta-analysis found no significant difference in childhood allergy incidence (2
      studies; typical RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37, 1.44). No significant difference was
      reported in one study in infant asthma (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86, 1.40), infant
      eczema (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.95, 1.52), childhood eczema prevalence (RR 1.10, 95% CI
      0.73, 1.68), infant rhinitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76, 1.16) or childhood rhinitis
      prevalence (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73, 2.00). Meta-analysis found no significant
      difference in childhood asthma incidence (3 studies, 728 infants; typical RR
      0.71, 95% CI 0.26, 1.92), childhood eczema incidence (2 studies, 283 infants;
      typical RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.90, 2.75) or childhood rhinitis incidence (2 studies,
      283 infants; typical RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.06, 8.00). One study reported no
      significant difference in infant CMPI (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.45, 2.62), infant CMA
      (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.24, 4.86), childhood soy protein allergy incidence (RR 3.26,
      95% CI 0.36, 29.17) and urticaria. No study compared soy formula to hydrolysed
      protein formula. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Feeding with a soy formula cannot be
      recommended for prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants at high risk
      of allergy or food intolerance. Further research may be warranted to determine
      the role of soy formulas for prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants
      unable to be breast fed with a strong family history of allergy or cow's milk
      protein intolerance.

TI  - Formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergy and food
      intolerance in infants.
PG  - CD003664
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergies and food reactions are common and may be associated with
      foods including adapted cow's milk formula. Formulas containing hydrolysed
      proteins have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance.
      However, it is unclear whether hydrolysed formula can be advocated for prevention
      of allergy and food intolerance in infants without evidence of allergy or food
      intolerance. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of feeding hydrolysed formulas
      on allergy and food intolerance in infants and children compared to adapted cow's
      milk or human breast milk. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to determine
      what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective including extensively and
      partially hydrolysed formulas. To determine which infants benefit, including
      infants at low or high risk of allergy and infants receiving early, short term or
      prolonged formula feeding. SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of the
      Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. The review was updated with searches of 
      the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane
      Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966-March 2006), EMBASE (1980-March 2006) and 
      CINAHL (1982-March 2006) and previous reviews including cross references.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use
      of a hydrolysed infant formula to human milk or cow's milk formula. Trials with
      >80% follow up of participants were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data
      extraction were assessed independently by each review author. Primary outcomes
      included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Meta-analysis
      was conducted using a fixed effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials compared
      early, short term hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding. No significant
      difference in infant allergy or childhood cow's milk allergy (CMA) were reported.
      No eligible trial compared prolonged hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding.
      Two trials compared early, short term hydrolysed formula to cow's milk formula
      feeding. No significant benefits were reported. One large quasi-random study
      reported a reduction in infant CMA of borderline significance in low risk infants
      (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38, 1.00). Ten eligible studies compared prolonged feeding
      with hydrolysed formula versus cow's milk formula in high risk infants.
      Meta-analysis found a significant reduction in infant allergy (seven studies,
      2514 infants; typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66, 0.94), but not in the incidence of
      childhood allergy (two studies, 950 infants; typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69, 1.05).
      There was no significant difference in infant eczema (eight studies, 2558
      infants, typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68, 1.04), childhood eczema incidence (two
      studies, 950 infants, typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63, 1.10), childhood eczema
      prevalence (one study, 872 infants; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43, 1.02), or infant or
      childhood asthma, rhinitis and food allergy. One study reported a significant
      reduction in infants with CMA with confirmed atopy (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15, 0.89). 
      Subgroup analysis of trials blinded to formula found no significant difference in
      infant allergy (four studies, 2156 infants; typical RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69, 1.08)
      or childhood allergy incidence (one study, 872 infants; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73,
      1.14). No eligible trial examined the effect of prolonged hydrolysed formula
      feeding on allergy beyond early childhood. There is evidence that preterm or low 
      birthweight infants fed a hydrolysed preterm formula have significantly reduced
      weight gain, but not in other growth parameters (head circumference or length).
      Studies in term infants report no adverse effects on growth. Subgroup analysis of
      trials of partially hydrolysed versus cow's milk formula found a significant
      reduction in infant allergy (six studies, 1391 infants; typical RR 0.79, 95% CI
      0.65, 0.97) but not childhood allergy, or infant or childhood asthma, eczema or
      rhinitis. Methodological concerns were the same as for the overall analysis.
      Analysis of trials of extensively hydrolysed formula versus cow's milk formula
      found no significant differences in allergy or food intolerance. Infants fed
      extensively hydrolysed formula compared with partially hydrolysed formula had a
      significant reduction in food allergy (two studies, 341 infants; typical RR 0.43,
      95% CI 0.19, 0.99), but there was no significant difference in all allergy or any
      other specific allergy incidence. Comparing extensively hydrolysed casein
      containing formula with cow's milk formula, one study (431 infants) reported a
      significant reduction in childhood allergy incidence (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53,
      0.97). Meta-analysis found a significant reduction in infant eczema (three
      studies, 1237 infants; typical RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51, 0.97). One study reported a 
      significant reduction in childhood eczema incidence (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44, 0.98) 
      and prevalence (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27, 0.92). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no
      evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula for the prevention of
      allergy compared to exclusive breast feeding. In high risk infants who are unable
      to be completely breast fed, there is limited evidence that prolonged feeding
      with a hydrolysed formula compared to a cow's milk formula reduces infant and
      childhood allergy and infant CMA. In view of methodological concerns and
      inconsistency of findings, further large, well designed trials comparing formulas
      containing partially hydrolysed whey, or extensively hydrolysed casein to cow's
      milk formulas are needed.

TI  - Nedocromil sodium for chronic asthma in children.
PG  - CD004108
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently inhaled corticosteroids are the main stay in the
      maintenance treatment of chronic asthma in children. Although inhaled
      corticosteroids play a crucial role in the management of childhood asthma, the
      long-term side effects of inhaled corticosteroids used in the management of
      chronic asthma in children are not clearly known. OBJECTIVES: The objective of
      this review is to compare the safety and efficacy of inhaled nedocromil sodium
      with placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma in children. SEARCH STRATEGY: We 
      searched the Cochrane airway group trials register, Cochrane controlled trials
      register, Current contents, review articles, reference lists of articles. We also
      contacted the drug manufacturer and primary authors for additional citations. We 
      also searched abstracts of major respiratory society meetings. The last search
      was carried out in October 2004 SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised placebo controlled
      trials comparing nedocromil sodium to placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma 
      in children (0 to 18 years). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors
      independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were
      contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen trials (twelve
      parallel group studies; three crossover trials recruiting 1422 children (837
      males and 585 females)) were included. The studies were generally of good
      methodological quality. Two large long term studies used nedocromil for six
      months and four to six years and showed conflicting results in symptom free days.
      Short term studies (duration between 4 weeks to 12 weeks) showed that nedocromil 
      sodium produced some improvement in a number of efficacy measures compared to
      placebo including FEV(1), FVC, FEV(1) % predicted, PC20 FEV(1), evening PEF and
      symptom scores. The parent's assessment of efficacy was in favour of nedocromil
      (odds ratio (OR) 0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to 0.8). Nedocromil sodium has a good safety
      profile. The only significant side effect observed was unpleasant taste. There
      was little evidence for a clinically dose response effect and only a few studies 
      recruited participants with severe asthma. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A limited number
      of small studies have shown that nedocromil is of benefit in improving lung
      function and some measures of symptoms, but the evidence with regard to the
      primary outcome of the review was conflicting. Two long-term trials did not show 
      consistent effects on lung function outcomes, whereas several small short-term
      trials have shown benefit in these outcomes. Differing severities at baseline may
      explain this difference with milder participants experiencing less benefit,
      although the discrepancy between study findings may also reflect publication
      bias. Nedocromil sodium is associated with a very good safety profile with no
      significant short term or long- term adverse side effects. Although nedocromil
      may have advantages over inhaled corticosteroids in terms of side effects, there 
      is a need for head to head trials of nedocromil and inhaled corticosteroids to
      establish whether asthma control is similar, especially in mild asthma. It is not
      yet clear where nedocromil should sit in relation to other therapies in the
      treatment of asthma in children.

TI  - Health hazards from volcanic gases: a systematic literature review.
PG  - 628-39
AB  - Millions of people are potentially exposed to volcanic gases worldwide, and
      exposures may differ from those in anthropogenic air pollution. A systematic
      literature review found few primary studies relating to health hazards of
      volcanic gases. SO2 and acid aerosols from eruptions and degassing events were
      associated with respiratory morbidity and mortality but not childhood asthma
      prevalence or lung function decrements. Accumulations of H2S and CO2 from
      volcanic and geothermal sources have caused fatalities from asphyxiation. Chronic
      exposure to H2S in geothermal areas was associated with increases in nervous
      system and respiratory diseases. Some impacts were on a large scale, affecting
      several countries (e.g., Laki fissure eruption in Iceland in 1783-4). No studies 
      on health effects of volcanic releases of halogen gases or metal vapors were
      located. More high quality collaborative studies involving volcanologists and
      epidemiologists are recommended.

TI  - Does antibiotic exposure during infancy lead to development of asthma?: a
      systematic review and metaanalysis.
PG  - 610-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between antibiotic exposure in the first
      year of life and the development of childhood asthma. DESIGN: Metaanalysis of
      observational studies retrieved through systematic search of all available
      electronic data sources. Studies included in the metaanalyses were those with
      populations exposed to one or more courses of antibiotics during the first year
      of life, and asthma diagnosis was defined as diagnosis by a physician between the
      age of 1 to 18 years. SETTING: Retrospective and prospective studies published in
      the English-language literature from 1966 to present. RESULTS: Eight studies
      (four prospective and four retrospective) examined the association between
      exposure to at least one course of antibiotics and development of childhood
      asthma. The total number of subjects for the analysis comparing exposure to at
      least one antibiotic to no exposure in the first year of life was 12,082 children
      and 1,817 asthma cases. In the dose-response analysis, we included data from a
      total of 27,167 children and 3,392 asthma cases. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for
      the eight studies was 2.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41 to 2.99). The
      association was significantly stronger in the retrospective studies (OR, 2.82;
      95% CI, 2.07 to 3.85) than the prospective studies (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.88 to
      1.42). Five of the eight studies examined whether the association was related to 
      the number of courses of antibiotics taken in the first year of life. The overall
      OR for the dose-response analysis was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.28) for each
      additional course of antibiotics; however, this association was not significantly
      stronger in the retrospective studies (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.60) relative
      to the prospective studies (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.20). CONCLUSIONS:
      Exposure to at least one course of antibiotics in the first year of life appears 
      to be a risk factor for the development of childhood asthma. Because of the
      limitations of the studies conducted to date, additional large-scale, prospective
      studies are needed to confirm this potential association.

TI  - Oral xanthines as maintenance treatment for asthma in children.
PG  - CD002885
AB  - BACKGROUND: Xanthines have been used in the treatment of asthma as a
      bronchodilator, though they may also have anti-inflammatory effects. The current 
      role of xanthines in the long-term treatment of childhood asthma needs to be
      reassessed. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of xanthines (e.g.
      theophylline) in the maintenance treatment of paediatric asthma. SEARCH STRATEGY:
      A search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register was undertaken with
      predefined search terms. Searches are current to May 2005. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Randomised controlled trials,lasting at least four weeks comparing a xanthine
      with placebo, regular short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), inhaled corticosteroids
      (ICS), cromoglycate (SCG), ketotifen (KET) or leukotriene antagonist, in children
      with diagnosed with chronic asthma between 18 months and 18 years old. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently selected each study for
      inclusion in the review and extracted data. Primary outcome was percentage of
      symptom-free days. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-four studies (2734 participants) of
      adequate quality were included. Xanthine versus placebo (17 studies): The
      proportion of symptom free days was larger with xanthine compared with placebo
      (7.97% [95% CI 3.41, 12.53]). Rescue medication usage was lower with xanthine,
      with no significant difference in symptom scores or hospitalisations. FEV1 , and 
      PEF were better with xanthine. Xanthine was associated with non - specific
      side-effects. Data from behavioural scores were inconclusive. Xanthine versus ICS
      (four studies) : Exacerbations were less frequent with ICS, but no significant
      difference on lung function was observed. Individual studies reported significant
      improvements in symptom measures in favour of steroids, and one study reported a 
      difference in growth rate in favour of xanthine. No difference was observed for
      study withdrawal or tremor. Xanthine was associated with more frequent headache
      and nausea. Xanthine versus regular SABA (10 studies): No significant difference 
      in symptoms, rescue medication usage and spirometry. Individual studies reported 
      improvement in PEF with beta-agonist. Beta-agonist treatment led to fewer
      hospitalisations and headaches. Xanthine was associated with less tremor.
      Xanthine versus SCG (six studies ): No significant difference in symptoms,
      exacerbations and rescue medication. Sodium cromoglycate was associated with
      fewer gastro-intestinal side-effects than xanthine. Xanthine versus KET (one
      study): No statistical tests of significance between xanthine and ketotifen were 
      reported. Xanthine + ICS versus placebo + same dose ICS (three studies) : Results
      were conflicting due to clinical/methodological differences, and could not be
      aggregated. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Xanthines as first-line preventer alleviate
      symptoms and reduce requirement for rescue medication in children with mild to
      moderate asthma. When compared with ICS they were less effective in preventing
      exacerbations. Xanthines had similar efficacy as single preventative agent
      compared with regular SABA and SCG. Evidence on AEs (adverse effects) was
      equivocal: there was evidence for increased AEs overall, but no evidence that any
      specific AE (including effects on behaviour and attention) occurred more
      frequently than with placebo. There is insufficient evidence from available
      studies to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of xanthines as add-on
      preventative treatment to ICS, and there are no published paediatric studies
      comparing xanthines with alternatives in this role. Our data suggest that
      xanthines are only suitable as first-line preventative asthma therapy in children
      when ICS are not available. They may have a role as add-on therapy in more severe
      asthma not controlled by ICS, but further studies are needed to examine this, and
      to define the risk-benefit ratio compared with other agents.

TI  - Anticholinergic drugs for wheeze in children under the age of two years.
PG  - CD001279
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wheeze in infancy and early childhood is common and appears to be
      increasing though the magnitude of any increase is unclear. Most wheezing
      episodes in infancy are precipitated by respiratory viral infections. Treatment
      of very young children with wheeze remains controversial. Anti-cholinergics are
      often prescribed but practice varies widely and the efficacy of this form of
      therapy remains the subject for debate. OBJECTIVES: Wheeze in infancy and early
      childhood is common and appears to be increasing. Most wheezing episodes in
      infancy are a result of viral infection. Bronchodilator medications such as
      beta2-agonists and anti-cholinergic agents are often used to relieve symptoms,
      but patterns of use vary. The objective of this review was to assess the effects 
      of anti-cholinergic therapy in the treatment of wheezing infants. This is a
      second update of this review. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways
      Group Specialised Register of trials and the reference lists of articles. We
      contacted researchers in the field and industry sources. Searches were current as
      of June 2004. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials that compared
      anti-cholinergic therapy with placebo or beta2-agonists in wheezing children
      under two years of age. Children with acute bronchiolitis and chronic lung
      disease were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Eligibility for inclusion
      and quality of trials were assessed independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS:
      Six trials involving 321 infants in three different settings were included.
      Compared with beta2-agonist alone, the combination of ipratropium bromide and
      beta2-agonist was associated with a reduced need for additional treatment, but no
      difference was seen in treatment response, respiratory rate or oxygen saturation 
      improvement in the emergency department. There was no significant difference in
      length of hospital stay between ipratropium bromide and placebo; or between
      ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist combined compared with beta2-agonist alone.
      However, combined ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist compared to placebo
      showed significantly improved clinical scores at 24 hours. Parents preferred
      ipratropium bromide over nebulised water or placebo for relief of their
      children's symptoms at home. A further updated search conducted in June 2004 did 
      not yield any new studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is not enough evidence to 
      support the uncritical use of anti-cholinergic therapy for wheezing infants,
      although parents using it at home were able to identify benefits.

TI  - Family therapy for chronic asthma in children.
PG  - CD000089
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial and emotional factors are important in childhood asthma.
      Nevertheless, drug therapy alone continues to be the main treatment. Treatment
      programmes that include behavioural or psychological interventions have been
      developed to improve disturbed family relations in the families of children with 
      severe asthma. These approaches have been extended to examine the efficacy of
      family therapy to treat childhood asthma in a wider group of patients. This
      review systematically examines these studies. OBJECTIVES: Recognition that asthma
      can be associated with emotional disturbances has led to the investigation of the
      role of family therapy in reducing the symptoms and impact of asthma in children.
      The objective of this review was to assess the effects of family therapy as an
      adjunct to medication for the treatment of asthma in children. SEARCH STRATEGY:
      We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, Psychlit and Psychinfo.
      Searches are current as of January 2005. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials
      comparing children undergoing systematic therapy focusing on the family in
      conjunction with asthma medication, with children taking asthma medication only. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers assessed the studies for inclusion in
      the review. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials with a total of 55 children were included.
      It was not possible to combine the findings of these two studies because of
      differences in outcome measures used. In one study, gas volume, peak expiratory
      flow rate and daytime wheeze showed improvement in family therapy patients
      compared to controls. In the other study, there was an improvement in overall
      clinical assessment and number of functionally impaired days in the patients
      receiving family therapy. There was no difference in forced expiratory volume or 
      medication use in both studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some indication
      that family therapy may be a useful adjunct to medication for children with
      asthma. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of
      standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.

TI  - The measurement of health-related quality of life (QOL) in paediatric clinical
      trials: a systematic review.
PG  - 66
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of much care in chronic childhood illness is to improve
      quality of life (QOL). However, surveys suggest QOL measures are not routinely
      included. In addition, there is little consensus about the quality of many QOL
      measures. OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent to which quality of life (QOL)
      measures are used in paediatric clinical trials and evaluate the quality of
      measures used. DESIGN: Systematic literature review. REVIEW METHODS: Included
      paediatric trials published in English between 1994 and 2003 involving children
      and adolescents up to the age of 20 years, and use of a standardised QOL measure.
      Data Sources included MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMB Reviews, AMED, BNI, PSYCHINFO, the
      Cochrane library, Internet, and reference lists from review articles. RESULTS: We
      identified 18 trials including assessment of QOL (4 Asthma, 4 Rhinitis, 2
      Dermatitis, and single studies of Eczema, Cystic fibrosis, Otis media, Amblyopia,
      Diabetes, Obesity associated with a brain tumour, Idiopathic short stature, and
      Congenital agranulocytosis). In three trials, parents rated their own QOL but not
      their child's. Fourteen different QOL measures were used but only two fulfilled
      our minimal defined criteria for quality. CONCLUSIONS: This review confirms
      previous reports of limited use of QOL measures in paediatric clinical trials.
      Our review provides information about availability and quality of measures which 
      will be of especial value to trial developers.

TI  - The social and economic consequences of childhood asthma across the lifecourse: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 711-28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma prevalence rates are high, and may be increasing in the
      Western world, particularly among children. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      the longer-term social and economic consequences of having asthma as a child and 
      to determine whether adverse consequences are more severe for poorer children.
      METHODS: Results from published and unpublished, quantitative and qualitative
      studies were synthesized narratively to examine the impact of childhood-onset
      asthma on school attendance, academic achievement and employment in adulthood.
      The question of whether the impact differed for different social groups was also 
      examined. FINDINGS: Twenty-nine good quality studies were identified, including
      in total 12 183 children with asthma or wheeze. Compared with asymptomatic
      children, those with asthma missed more days of school (additional absence as a
      result of asthma ranged from 2.1 to 14.8 days). Studies of academic achievement
      found that children with asthma performed as well as their healthy peers. The
      existing evidence on labour market performance is sparse, but there is an
      indication that people with asthma during childhood experience disadvantage in
      later employment. In an examination of consequences by social position, children 
      with asthma from deprived areas were more likely to miss school than their more
      affluent peers, and minority ethnic children were also more likely to have poor
      school attendance. The only qualitative study suggested that children with asthma
      strove to participate fully in every aspect of their daily lives. INTERPRETATION:
      Although asthma limits children's daily activities and affects their social
      activities, this research synthesis found little evidence of major, adverse
      long-term social and economic consequences in studies reviewed. Further
      longitudinal research using comparison groups is needed to fill key gaps in the
      existing evidence base.

TI  - Risk factors for asthma incidence. A review of recent prospective evidence.
PG  - 97-110
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study is to determine what factors have been shown, in
      prospective studies, to predict the incidence of asthma. METHODS: We performed a 
      systematic review of peer-reviewed literature from 1994 to 2004 to determine what
      factors predict the development of asthma in both children and adults. This
      search strategy yielded 40 studies, with 36 providing some estimate of asthma
      incidence for the total sample and or a specific subgroup. RESULTS: Annual
      estimated incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma ranged from 0.6 to 29.5 per
      1000 persons. Risk factors for incident asthma among children included: male sex,
      atopic sensitization, parental history of asthma, early-life stressors and
      infections, obesity, and exposure to indoor allergens, tobacco smoke and outdoor 
      pollutants. Risk factors for adult-onset asthma included female sex, airway
      hyperresponsiveness, lifestyle factors, and work-related exposures. CONCLUSION:
      Risk factors for asthma include both modifiable and nonmodifiable ones, and they 
      vary between children and adults. This review of prospective evidence supports
      tobacco and smoke avoidance as an intervention for the primary prevention of
      childhood asthma. During adolescence and adulthood, targeting lifestyle factors
      like obesity and smoking or reducing occupational exposures are the best
      opportunities for asthma prevention. Before specific public health
      recommendations can be made, however, additional longitudinal research is needed 
      to better characterize target populations and identify appropriate settings for
      multifaceted asthma interventions.

TI  - The effect of chronic or intermittent hypoxia on cognition in childhood: a review
      of the evidence.
PG  - 805-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A review of the evidence concerning the effect of chronic or
      intermittent hypoxia on cognition in childhood was performed by using both a
      systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal criteria of causality.
      Because of the significant impact of behavioral disorders such as
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder on certain cognitive functions as well
      as academic achievement, the review also included articles that addressed
      behavioral outcomes. METHODS: Both direct and indirect evidence were collected. A
      structured Medline search was conducted from the years 1966-2000 by using the
      OVID interface. Both English- and non-English-language citations were included.
      Significant articles identified by the reviewers up to 2003 were also included.
      To be included as direct evidence, an article needed to be an original report in 
      a peer-reviewed journal with data on cognitive, behavioral, or academic outcomes 
      in children up to 14 years old, with clinical conditions likely to be associated 
      with exposure to chronic or intermittent hypoxia. Indirect evidence from other
      reviews and publications in closely related fields, including experimental
      studies in adults, was used to help formulate conclusions. Two reviewers screened
      abstracts and titles. Each article included as direct evidence received a
      structured evaluation by 2 reviewers. Adjudication of differences was performed
      by a group of 2 reviewers and a research consultant. After this review, tables of
      evidence were constructed that were used as the basis for group discussion and
      consensus development. Indirect evidence assigned by topic to specific reviewers 
      was also presented as part of this process. A formal procedure was used to rank
      the studies by design strength. The critical appraisal criteria for causation
      described in Evidence Based Pediatrics and Child Health (Moyer V, Elliott E,
      Davis R, et al, eds. London, United Kingdom: BMJ Books; 2000:46-55) were used to 
      develop consensus on causality. RESULTS: A total of 788 literature citations were
      screened. For the final analysis, 55 articles met the criteria for inclusion in
      the direct evidence. Of these, 43 (78.2%) reported an adverse effect. Of the 37
      controlled studies, 31 (83.8%) reported an adverse effect. Adverse effects were
      noted at every level of arterial oxygen saturation and for exposure at every age 
      level except for premature newborns. The studies were classified into 5 clinical 
      categories: congenital heart disease (CHD), sleep-disordered breathing (SDB),
      asthma, chronic ventilatory impairment, and respiratory instability in infants.
      Two of these categories, CHD and SDB, which accounted for 42 (76.4%) of the
      included articles, fulfilled the Evidence Based Pediatrics and Child Health
      criteria for causation. The indirect evidence included 8 reviews, 1
      meta-analysis, and 10 original reports covering the fields of adult anoxia,
      animal research, SDB in adults, natural and experimental high-altitude studies,
      perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, anemia, and carbon-monoxide poisoning.
      The studies of high-altitude and carbon-monoxide poisoning provided evidence for 
      causality. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse impacts of chronic or intermittent hypoxia on
      development, behavior, and academic achievement have been reported in many
      well-designed and controlled studies in children with CHD and SDB as well as in a
      variety of experimental studies in adults. This should be taken into account in
      any situation that may expose children to hypoxia. Because adverse effects have
      been noted at even mild levels of oxygen desaturation, future research should
      include precisely defined data on exposure to all levels of desaturation.

TI  - Soy formula for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants.
PG  - CD003741
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergies and food reactions in infants and children are common and
      may be associated with foods including adapted cow's milk formulas. Soy based
      formulas have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance.
      However, it is unclear whether they can be advocated for the prevention of
      allergy and food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of allergy or
      food intolerance. OBJECTIVES: In infants without clinical evidence of allergy or 
      food intolerance, to determine whether feeding them an adapted soy formula
      compared to human milk, cow's milk formula or a hydrolysed protein formula
      prevents allergy or food intolerance. SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search
      strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used including searches of the
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library,
      Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 - January 2004), EMBASE (1980 - January 2004),
      CINAHL (1982 - December 2003) and previous reviews including cross references.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use
      of an adapted soy formula to human milk, an adapted cow's milk or a hydrolysed
      protein formula for infant feeding in the first 6 months. Only trials with > 80% 
      follow up of participants and reported in group of assignment were eligible for
      inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Eligibility of studies for inclusion,
      methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each
      reviewer. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food
      intolerance. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model where no
      heterogeneity of treatment effect existed, and a random effects model when
      heterogeneity was found. MAIN RESULTS: Five eligible studies were found, all
      enrolling infants at high risk of allergy on the basis of a family history of
      allergy in a first degree relative. All studies compared use of a soy to a cow's 
      milk formula. Two studies also included a group fed a formula containing
      hydrolysed protein. No eligible study enrolled infants fed human milk. No study
      examined the effect of early, short term soy formula feeding. Three studies were 
      of good methodology and did not have unbalanced allergy-preventing
      co-interventions in the treatment groups. Comparing soy to cow's milk formula,
      one study with unclear allocation concealment and 19.5% losses to follow up
      reported a reduction in cumulative incidence of childhood allergy, asthma and
      allergic rhinitis. No other study reported a significant benefit for any allergy 
      or food intolerance. Analysis found no significant difference in allergy
      cumulative incidence in infancy (one study: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69, 1.49) or
      childhood (3 studies: typical RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37, 1.44) and no significant
      difference in cumulative incidence or period prevalence of any specific allergy
      or food intolerance in infancy or childhood. Analysis of studies comparing soy to
      a hydrolysed formula found a significant increase in infant (one study: RR 1.67, 
      95% CI 1.03, 2.69) and childhood allergy cumulative incidence (one study: RR
      1.55, 95% CI 1.02, 2.35), infant eczema cumulative incidence (2 studies: typical 
      RR 2.34, 95% CI 1.51, 3.62) and childhood food allergy period prevalence (one
      study: RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.09, 3.02). REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: Feeding with a soy
      formula should not be recommended for the prevention of allergy or food
      intolerance in infants at high risk of allergy or food intolerance.

TI  - Formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergy and food
      intolerance in infants.
PG  - CD003664
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergies and food reactions are common and may be associated with
      foods including adapted cow's milk formulas. Formulas containing hydrolysed
      proteins have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance, and
      have been advocated for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine whether use of hydrolysed formulas for infant feeding
      prevents allergy and food intolerance. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to
      determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective including extensively
      and partially hydrolysed formulas. To determine which infants benefit including
      infants at low or high risk of allergy and infants receiving early, short term or
      prolonged formula feeding. SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of the
      Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used including searches of the Cochrane
      Controlled Trials Register (2003, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 - January 2003), EMBASE
      (1980 - January 2003) and CINAHL (1982 - January 2003) and previous reviews
      including cross references. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised
      trials that compare the use of a hydrolysed infant formula to human milk or cow's
      milk formula. Trials with >80% follow up of participants were eligible for
      inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Eligibility of studies for inclusion,
      methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each
      reviewer. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food
      intolerance. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model. MAIN
      RESULTS: Eighteen trials met criteria for inclusion. No eligible trials compared 
      prolonged hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding. Two trials compared early,
      short term hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding and reported no significant
      difference in infant allergy or childhood cow's milk allergy (CMA). Two trials
      compared early, short term hydrolysed formula to cow's milk formula feeding with 
      no significant benefits reported. One large quasi-random study reported a
      reduction in infant CMA of borderline significance in low risk infants (RR 0.62, 
      95% CI 0.38, 1.00).Seven studies compared prolonged feeding of hydrolysed formula
      to cow's milk formula without using co-interventions for allergy prevention.
      Meta-analysis of 4 studies (386 infants) found a significant reduction in allergy
      incidence in infancy (typical RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47, 0.85; RD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25,
      -0.06). One study reported a significant reduction in allergy incidence in
      childhood (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36, 0.81). Significant reductions were found in
      asthma prevalence in childhood, eczema incidence in infancy and prevalence in
      childhood, food allergy prevalence in childhood, and CMA incidence in infancy.
      All studies enrolled infants at high risk of allergy. Only three trials comparing
      prolonged hydrolysed formula feeding to cow's milk formula feeding were
      considered of good methodology. Only one of these trials demonstrated a benefit
      into childhood (5 years of age). No eligible trials examined the effects of
      prolonged hydrolysed formula feeding on allergy beyond early childhood. Costs
      were not reported. Three trials compared prolonged feeding with an extensive to a
      partially hydrolysed formula and reported no significant difference in allergy
      incidence in infancy. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support
      feeding with a hydrolysed formula for the prevention of allergy in preference to 
      exclusive breast feeding. In high risk infants who are unable to be completely
      breast fed, there is evidence that prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed compared
      to a cow's milk formula reduces infant and childhood allergy and infant CMA.
      Further trials are required to determine if significant clinical benefits persist
      beyond 5 years of age and if there is any additional benefit from use of an

      formula and the effect on compliance should be measured.

TI  - Anticholinergic therapy for chronic asthma in children over two years of age.
PG  - CD003535
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the intrinsic system of controlling airway calibre, the
      cholinergic (muscarinic) sympathetic nervous system has an important role.
      Anticholinergic, anti muscarinic bronchodilators such as ipratropium bromide are 
      frequently used in the management of childhood airway disease. In asthma,
      ipratropium is a less potent bronchodilator than beta-2 adrenergic agents but it 
      is known to be a useful adjunct to other therapies, particularly in status
      asthmaticus. What remains unclear is the role of anticholinergic drugs in the
      maintenance treatment of chronic asthma. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
      effectiveness of anticholinergic drugs in chronic asthma in children over the age
      of 2 years. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Airways Group trials register and
      reference lists of articles were searched in January 2002. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Randomised controlled trials in which anticholinergic drugs were given for
      chronic asthma in children over 2 years of age were included. Studies including
      comparison of: anticholinergics with placebo, and anticholinergics with any other
      drug were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Eligibility for inclusion and
      quality of trials were assessed independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS:
      Eight studies met the inclusion criteria.Three papers compared the effects of
      anticholinergic drugs with placebo, and a meta-analysis of these results
      demonstrated no statistically significant benefit of the use of anticholinergic
      drugs over placebo in any of the outcome measures used. The results of one of
      these trials could not be included in the meta-analysis but the authors did
      report significantly lower symptom scores with inhaled anticholinergics compared 
      with placebo. However, there was no significant difference between ipratropium
      bromide and placebo in the percentage of symptom-free nights or days. Two trials 
      studied the effects of anticholinergics on bronchial hyper responsiveness to
      histamine, by measuring the provocation dose of histamine needed to cause a fall 
      of 20 % in FEV1 (PD 20). One study (comparing anticholinergics with placebo)
      reported a statistically significant increase in PD 20 but this was not found in 
      another study (comparing anticholinergics with a beta-2 agonist). Both trials
      also examined the effect of anticholinergic drugs on diurnal variation in peak
      expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and reported no significant effect. Two studies
      compared the addition of an anticholinergic drug to a beta-2 agonist with the
      beta-2 agonist alone. Both trials failed to show any significant benefit from the
      long term use of combined anticholinergics with beta-2 agonists compared with
      beta-2 agonists alone. One trial compared the effects of oral and inhaled
      anticholinergic drugs with placebo. No statistically significant differences were
      found in any of the outcome measures except for a higher FEV1 / VC ratio and RV /
      TLC ratio with oral anticholinergic therapy when compared with placebo.
      REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The present review summarises the best evidence available
      to date. Although there were some small beneficial findings in favour of
      anticholinergic therapy, there is insufficient data to support the use of
      anticholinergic drugs in the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma in children.

TI  - Inhaled sodium cromoglycate for asthma in children.
PG  - CD002173
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium cromoglycate has been recommended as maintenance treatment for
      childhood asthma for many years. Its use has decreased since 1990, when inhaled
      corticosteroids became popular, but it is still used in many countries.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of sodium cromoglycate compared to placebo 
      in the prophylactic treatment of children with asthma. SEARCH STRATEGY: We
      searched the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma trials register (November 2002), the
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library
      Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2002), EMBASE (January 1985 to 
      November 2002) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted the
      pharmaceutical company manufacturing sodium cromoglycate SELECTION CRITERIA: All 
      double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trials, which addressed the
      effectiveness of inhaled sodium cromoglycate as maintenance therapy, studying
      children aged 0 up to 18 years with asthma. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two
      reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study results 
      were pooled. MAIN RESULTS: Of 3500 titles retrieved from the literature, 25
      papers reporting on 24 studies could be included in the review. The studies were 
      published between 1970 and 1997 and together included 1074 participants. Most
      were cross-over studies. Few studies provided sufficient information to judge the
      concealment of allocation. Four studies provided results for the proportion of
      symptom-free days. Pooling the results did not reveal a statistically significant
      difference between sodium cromoglycate and placebo. For most of the other
      outcomes, the results were similar: small effect size and a confidence interval
      including the point of no difference. The funnel plot showed an under
      representation of small studies with negative results, suggesting publication
      bias. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of the efficacy of sodium cromoglycate
      over placebo is not proven. Publication bias is likely to have overestimated the 
      beneficial effects of sodium cromoglycate as maintenance therapy in childhood
      asthma.

TI  - Cow's milk protein avoidance and development of childhood wheeze in children with
      a family history of atopy.
PG  - CD003795
AB  - BACKGROUND: In infants with a family history of atopy, food allergen avoidance
      has been advocated as means of preventing the development of atopic disease when 
      breast-feeding is not possible or supplemental feeding is needed. Most infant
      formulas are based on cow's milk protein. Alternative choices include soya based 
      and hydrolysed cows milk formulas. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effect of dietary 
      avoidance of cow's milk protein on the development of asthma or wheeze in
      children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane database was searched for eligible trials
      until February 2002. The full text papers of all abstracts identified as RCTs
      were obtained and reviewed independently by two reviewers. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Randomised controlled trials involving children with a family history of atopy in
      at least one first degree relative were considered if feeding with cow's milk
      based standard formula was compared to dietary avoidance of cow's milk protein
      using soya or other hypoallergenic formula during the initial four months of life
      or longer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers extracted data
      independently. A priori defined subgroups were the types of hypoallergenic
      artificial feed and dietary restrictions on mother and/or child's diet. MAIN
      RESULTS: Six trials used hydrolysed formula for at least 4 months in addition to 
      dietary restrictions and in some cases dust-mite reduction measures. The risk of 
      infants experiencing asthma or wheeze during the first year of life was reduced
      compared to standard cow's milk based formula (Relative Risk =0.40, 95%
      Confidence Intervals 0.19, 0.85). Feeding soya-based formula as opposed to
      standard cow's milk formula did not reduce the risk of having asthma or wheeze at
      any age. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Breast-milk should remain the feed of choice for
      all babies. In infants with at least one first degree relative with atopy,
      hydrolysed formula for a minimum of 4 months combined with dietary restrictions
      and environment measures may reduce the risk of developing asthma or wheeze in
      the first year of life. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that soya-based
      milk formula has any benefit.

TI  - Anticholinergic drugs for wheeze in children under the age of two years.
PG  - CD001279
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wheeze in infancy and early childhood is common and appears to be
      increasing though the magnitude of any increase is unclear. Most wheezing
      episodes in infancy are precipitated by respiratory viral infections. Treatment
      of very young children with wheeze remains controversial. Anti-cholinergics are
      often prescribed but practice varies widely and the efficacy of this form of
      therapy remains the subject for debate. OBJECTIVES: Wheeze in infancy and early
      childhood is common and appears to be increasing. Most wheezing episodes in
      infancy are a result of viral infection. Bronchodilator medications such as
      beta2-agonists and anti-cholinergic agents are often used to relieve symptoms,
      but patterns of use vary. The objective of this review was to assess the effects 
      of anti-cholinergic therapy in the treatment of wheezing infants. SEARCH
      STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and the
      reference lists of articles. We contacted researchers in the field and industry
      sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials that compared anti-cholinergic
      therapy with placebo or beta2-agonists in wheezing children under two years of
      age. Children with acute bronchiolitis and chronic lung disease were excluded.
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Eligibility for inclusion and quality of trials
      were assessed independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials involving 
      321 infants in three different settings were included. Compared with
      beta2-agonist alone, the combination of ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist was
      associated with a reduced need for additional treatment, but no difference was
      seen in treatment response, respiratory rate or oxygen saturation improvement in 
      the emergency department. There was no significant difference in length of
      hospital stay between ipratropium bromide and placebo; or between ipratropium
      bromide and beta2-agonist combined compared with beta2-agonist alone. However,
      combined ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist compared to placebo showed
      significantly improved clinical scores at 24 hours. Parents preferred ipratropium
      bromide over nebulised water or placebo for relief of their children's symptoms
      at home. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is not enough evidence to support the
      uncritical use of anti-cholinergic therapy for wheezing infants, although parents
      using it at home were able to identify benefits.

TI  - Breast-feeding and the risk of bronchial asthma in childhood: a systematic review
      with meta-analysis of prospective studies.
PG  - 261-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The protective effect of breast-feeding on the development of
      childhood asthma remains a matter of controversy. We conducted a systematic
      review of prospective studies that evaluated the association between exclusive
      breast-feeding during the first 3 months after birth and asthma. STUDY DESIGN: We
      searched the 1966-1999 MEDLINE database and reviewed reference lists of relevant 
      articles to identify 12 prospective studies that met pre-stated inclusion
      criteria. Methodological aspects of the studies, duration and exclusivity of
      breast-feeding, and outcomes were assessed. Effect estimates were abstracted by
      the investigators, using a standardized approach. RESULTS: The summary odds ratio
      (OR) for the protective effect of breast-feeding was 0.70 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.81). 
      The effect estimate was greater in studies of children with a family history of
      atopy (OR = 0.52) than in studies of a combined population (OR = 0.73).
      CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive breast-feeding during the first months after birth is
      associated with lower asthma rates during childhood. The effect, caused by
      immunomodulatory qualities of breast milk, avoidance of allergens, or a
      combination of these and other factors, strengthens the advantage of
      breast-feeding, especially if a family history of atopy is present.

TI  - Beclomethasone for asthma in children: effects on linear growth.
PG  - CD001282
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhaled steroids play a central role in the management of childhood
      asthma. There is concern about their side effects, especially on growth. However 
      asthma may also cause growth retardation. Growth rates are not stable, so
      randomised controlled parallel group studies are needed to assess the impact of
      inhaled steroids on growth. This review is confine to one inhaled steroid,
      beclomethasone, that is known to have significant levels of systemic absorption. 
      OBJECTIVES: To determine whether inhaled beclomethasone cause significant delay
      in the linear growth of children with asthma. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane
      Airways Group asthma register was searched. Bibliographies from included studies,
      and known reviews were searched for additional citations. Personal contact with
      colleagues and researchers working in the field of asthma were made to identify
      potentially relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, controlled trials
      comparing the effects of beclamethasone to non-steroidal medication (placebo or
      non-steroidal therapy) on the linear growth of children with asthma. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data related to the clinical outcome "change in growth" 
      were extracted by two reviewers working independently MAIN RESULTS: One hundred
      and fifty-nine citations were identified by the search strategy and bibliography 
      review. Three studies met the inclusion criteria. All used beclomethasone 200 mcg
      twice daily delivered by dry powder Diskhaler to treat children with
      mild-moderate asthma. Study duration was 7-12 months. In all three studies, a
      significant decrease in linear growth occurred in children treated with
      beclomethasone compared to those receiving placebo or non-steroidal asthma
      therapy. The average decrease, calculated through meta-analysis, was -1.54 cm per
      year (95% CI -1.15, -1.94). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: In children with
      mild-moderate asthma, beclomethasone 200 mcg twice daily caused a decrease in
      linear growth of -1.54 cm per year. These studies lasted a maximum of 54 weeks,
      so it remains unclear whether the decrease in growth is sustained or whether it
      reverses with 'catch up' after therapy is discontinued. We are unable to comment 
      on growth effects of other inhaled steroids that have potentially less systemic
      effects. If inhaled steroids are required to control a child's asthma, we
      recommend using the minimum dose that effectively controls the child's asthma and
      closely following growth.

TI  - Anti-cholinergic drugs for wheeze in children under the age of two years.
PG  - CD001279
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wheeze in infancy and early childhood is common and appears to be
      increasing though the magnitude of any increase is unclear. Most wheezing
      episodes in infancy are precipitated by respiratory viral infections. Treatment
      of very young children with wheeze remains controversial. Anti-cholinergics are
      often prescribed but practice varies widely and the efficacy of this form of
      therapy remains the subject for debate. OBJECTIVES: Wheeze in infancy and early
      childhood is common and appears to be increasing. Most wheezing episodes in
      infancy are a result of viral infection. Bronchodilator medications such as
      beta2-agonists and anti-cholinergic agents are often used to relieve symptoms,
      but patterns of use vary. The objective of this review was to assess the effects 
      of anti-cholinergic therapy in the treatment of wheezing infants. SEARCH
      STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and the
      reference lists of articles. We contacted researchers in the field and industry
      sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials that compared anti-cholinergic
      therapy with placebo or beta2-agonists in wheezing children under two years of
      age. Children with acute bronchiolitis and chronic lung disease were excluded.
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Eligibility for inclusion and quality of trials
      were assessed independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials involving 
      321 infants in three different settings were included. Compared with
      beta2-agonist alone, the combination of ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist was
      associated with a reduced need for additional treatment, but no difference was
      seen in treatment response, respiratory rate or oxygen saturation improvement in 
      the emergency department. There was no significant difference in length of
      hospital stay between ipratropium bromide and placebo; or between ipratropium
      bromide and beta2-agonist combined compared with beta2-agonist alone. However,
      combined ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist compared to placebo showed
      significantly improved clinical scores at 24 hours. Parents preferred ipratropium
      bromide over nebulised water or placebo for relief of their children's symptoms
      at home. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is not enough evidence to support the
      uncritical use of anti-cholinergic therapy for wheezing infants, although parents
      using it at home were able to identify benefits.

TI  - Inhaled steroids for episodic viral wheeze of childhood.
PG  - CD001107
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recurrent episodic wheeze in association with viral upper respiratory
      tract infection (URTI) is a specific clinical illness distinct from persistent
      atopic asthma. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to identify whether
      corticosteroid treatment, given episodically or daily, is beneficial to children 
      with viral episodic wheeze. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways
      Group trials register and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroid treatment versus placebo in
      children under 17 years of age who suffer from 'episodic viral wheeze', which is 
      defined by wheeze in association with coryzal symptoms with minimal or no
      intercurrent lower respiratory tract symptoms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
      Trial quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Study authors were
      contacted for missing information. Studies were categorised according to whether 
      treatment was given episodically or daily (maintenance). The primary outcome was 
      episodes requiring oral corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes addressed episode
      severity, frequency and duration and parental treatment preference. MAIN RESULTS:
      Five randomised controlled trials in children with a history of mild episodic
      viral wheeze were identified. Most of the children had previously required no or 
      infrequent oral corticosteroids and had very infrequent hospital admissions.
      There were three studies of preschool children given episodic high dose inhaled
      corticosteroid (1.6 - 2.25 mg per day), two using a crossover and one a parallel 
      design. The two studies of maintenance corticosteroid (400 micrograms per day)
      were parallel in design, one of pre-school children the other of children aged 7 
      -9 years. Results from the two cross-over studies of episodic high dose inhaled
      corticosteroids showed a reduced requirement for oral corticosteroids (Relative
      risk (RR)=0.53, 95% CI: 0.27, 1.04). In these 2 double blind studies, this
      treatment was preferred by the children's parents over placebo (RR=0.64, 95% CI: 
      0.48,0.87). Maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroids did not show any clear
      reduction over placebo in the proportion of episodes requiring oral
      corticosteroids (N=2 trials, RR=0.82, 95%CI: 0.23,2.90) or in those requiring
      hospital admission (N=1 trial, RR=0.21, 95% CI: 0.01,4.11). REVIEWER'S
      CONCLUSIONS: Episodic high dose inhaled corticosteroids provide a partially
      effective strategy for the treatment of mild episodic viral wheeze of childhood. 
      There is no current evidence to favour maintenance low dose inhaled
      corticosteroids in the prevention and management of episodic mild viral induced
      wheeze.

TI  - Family therapy for asthma in children.
PG  - CD000089
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial and emotional factors are important in childhood asthma.
      Nevertheless, drug therapy alone continues to be the main treatment. Treatment
      programmes that include behavioural or psychological interventions have been
      developed to improve disturbed family relations in the families of children with 
      severe asthma. These approaches have been extended to examine the efficacy of
      family therapy to treat childhood asthma in a wider group of patients. This
      review systematically examines these studies. OBJECTIVES: Recognition that asthma
      can be associated with emotional disturbances has led to the investigation of the
      role of family therapy in reducing the symptoms and impact of asthma in children.
      The objective of this review was to assess the effects of family therapy as an
      adjunct to medication for the treatment of asthma in children. SEARCH STRATEGY:
      We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, Psychlit and Psychinfo.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing children undergoing systematic
      therapy focusing on the family in conjunction with asthma medication, with
      children taking asthma medication only. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One
      reviewer applied the study inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials with a
      total of 55 children were included. It was not possible to combine the findings
      of these two studies because of differences in outcome measures used. In one
      study, gas volume, peak expiratory flow rate and daytime wheeze showed
      improvement in family therapy patients compared to controls. In the other study, 
      there was an improvement in overall clinical assessment and number of
      functionally impaired days in the patients receiving family therapy. There was no
      difference in forced expiratory volume or medication use in both studies.
      REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is some indication that family therapy may be a
      useful adjunct to medication for children with asthma. This conclusion is limited
      by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome
      measures.

TI  - Should inhaled anticholinergics be added to beta2 agonists for treating acute
      childhood and adolescent asthma? A systematic review.
PG  - 971-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the therapeutic and adverse effects of addition of
      inhaled anticholinergics to beta2 agonists in acute asthma in children and
      adolescents. DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of
      children and adolescents taking beta2 agonists for acute asthma with or without
      the addition of inhaled anticholinergics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital
      admission, pulmonary function tests, number of nebulised treatments, relapse, and
      adverse effects. RESULTS: Of 37 identified trials, 10 were relevant and six of
      these were of high quality. The addition of a single dose of anticholinergic to
      beta2 agonist did not reduce hospital admission (relative risk 0.93, 95%
      confidence interval 0.65 to 1.32). However, significant group differences in lung
      function supporting the combination treatment were observed 60 minutes
      (standardised mean difference -0.57, -0.93 to -0.21) and 120 minutes (-0.53,
      -0.90 to -0.17) after the dose of anticholinergic. In contrast, the addition of
      multiple doses of anticholinergics to beta2 agonists, mainly in children and
      adolescents with severe exacerbations, reduced the risk of hospital admission by 
      30% (relative risk 0.72, 0.53 to 0.99). Eleven (95% confidence interval 5 to 250)
      children would need to be treated to avoid one admission. A parallel improvement 
      in lung function (standardised mean difference -0.66, -0.95 to -0.37) was noted
      60 minutes after the last combined inhalation. In the single study where
      anticholinergics were systematically added to every beta2 agonist inhalation,
      irrespective of asthma severity, no group differences were observed for the few
      available outcomes. There was no increase in the amount of nausea, vomiting, or
      tremor in patients treated with anticholinergics. CONCLUSIONS: Adding multiple
      doses of anticholinergics to beta2 agonists seems safe, improves lung function,
      and may avoid hospital admission in 1 of 11 such treated patients. Although
      multiple doses should be preferred to single doses of anticholinergics, the
      available evidence only supports their use in school aged children and
      adolescents with severe asthma exacerbation.

TI  - Parental smoking, bronchial reactivity and peak flow variability in children.
PG  - 295-301
AB  - BACKGROUND: A systematic quantitative review was conducted of the evidence
      relating environmental tobacco smoke to bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR)
      during childhood. METHODS: Twenty-nine relevant studies were identified after
      consideration of 1593 articles selected by electronic search of the Embase and
      Medline databases using keywords relevant to passive smoking in children. The
      search was completed in April 1997. RESULTS: Of 19 studies using challenge tests 
      in children of school age, 10 (5759 children) could be summarised as the odds
      ratio of being bronchial hyperreactive in children exposed to environmental
      tobacco smoke compared with those not exposed. The pooled odds ratio for maternal
      smoking was 1.29 (95% confidence limits 1.10 to 1.50) with no evidence of
      heterogeneity between studies. However, in five further studies of 3531 children 
      providing some evidence, but not odds ratios, none were statistically
      significant. A further four studies on 5233 children have collected data but are 
      not published. In contrast, all four studies of circadian variation in peak
      expiratory flow found increased variation in children exposed to environmental
      tobacco smoke. CONCLUSIONS: A clear effect of exposure to environmental tobacco
      smoke on BHR in the general population has not been established. While the
      meta-analysis suggests a small but real increase in BHR in school aged children, 
      it seems likely that this estimate is biased upwards due to publication bias. In 
      contrast, limited evidence suggests greater variation in peak expiratory flow in 
      children of smoking parents.

      sectional surveys and wheezing in early childhood. METHODS: Fifty one relevant
      publications were identified after consideration of 1593 abstracts selected by
      electronic search of the Embase and Medline databases using keywords relevant to 
      passive smoking in children. The search was completed in April 1997 and
      identified six studies of asthma incidence, seven of prognosis, 22 case-control
      studies, and 10 case series addressing disease severity. RESULTS: Maternal
      smoking was associated with an increased incidence of wheezing illness up to age 
      6 (pooled odds ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.41), but less strongly thereafter
      (1.13, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22). The long term prognosis of early wheezing illness
      was better if the mother smoked. The pooled odds ratio for asthma prevalence from
      14 case-control studies was 1.37 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.64) if either parent smoked.
      Four studies suggest that parental smoking is more strongly associated with
      wheezing among non-atopic children. Indicators of disease severity including
      symptom scores, attack frequency, medication use, hospital attendance, and life
      threatening bronchospasm were in general positively related to household smoke
      exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The excess incidence of wheezing in smoking households
      appears to be largely non-atopic "wheezy bronchitis" with a relatively benign
      prognosis, but among children with established asthma, parental smoking is
      associated with more severe disease. This apparent paradox may be reconciled if
      environmental tobacco smoke is considered a co-factor provoking wheezing attacks,
      rather than a cause of the underlying asthmatic tendency.
